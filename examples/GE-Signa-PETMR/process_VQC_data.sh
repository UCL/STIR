#! /bin/bash -e
# An example script to process the VQC data (which has to be downloaded first).
# This data is special as it is just 5 point sources. We don't have an MRAC for this data-set.
# To illustrate the use the full scripts, we create a "fake" attenuation image.
# Aside from attenution processing, this should work for other data in GE RDF9 as well.
#
# To extract the RDF files from GE DICOM, we rely on nm_extract from https://github.com/UCL/pet-rd-tools
#
# Author: Kris Thielemans

# By default, it will find the parameter files in the pardir directory below.
# You can change the file, or run the script by doing something like
#    pardir=~/wherever/
#    export pardir
#    $pardir/process_VQC_data.sh
