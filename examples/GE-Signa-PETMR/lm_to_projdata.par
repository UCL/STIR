lm_to_projdata Parameters:=

  input file := ${INPUT}
  output filename prefix := ${OUTPUT}

  ; parameters that determine the sizes etc of the output

    template_projdata := ${TEMPLATE}
    ; the next can be used to use a smaller number of segments than given 
    ; in the template
    ;maximum absolute segment number to process := 

  ; parameters for saying which events will be stored

    ; time frames (see TimeFrameDefinitions doc for format)
    frame_definition file := ${FRAMES}
    ; or a total number of events (if  larger than 0, frame definitions will be ignored)
    ; note that this normally counts the total of prompts-delayeds (see below)
   ; num_events_to_store := -1

  ; parameters relating to prompts and delayeds

    ; with the default values, prompts will be added and delayed subtracted
    ; to give the usual estimate of the trues.

    ; store the prompts (value should be 1 or 0)
    store prompts := 1  ;default
    ; what to do if it's a delayed event
    store delayeds := 0  ;default

  ; miscellaneous parameters

    ; list each event on stdout and do not store any files (use only for testing!)
    ; has to be 0 or 1
    List event coordinates := 0

    ; if you're short of RAM (i.e. a single projdata does not fit into memory),
    ; you can use this to process the list mode data in multiple passes.
    num_segments_in_memory := -1
