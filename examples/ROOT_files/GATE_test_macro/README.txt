Example macros for the scanner used in the recon_test_pack to 
validate the GATE-STIR interface. 

The scanner geometry is a simple 4 ring scanner. 
Should you want to use it you have to design a proper phantom (and a source). 
In addition, a physics.mac file is not provided because of the different 
versions of Geant4. 

Cheers!
