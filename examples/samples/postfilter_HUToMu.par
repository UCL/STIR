PostFiltering parameters :=
; an example file using the HUToMu filter (or data processor) to convert
; a CT image in Hounsfield Units to mu-values, followed by some Gaussian smoothing
;
; The HUToMu filter takes a file in JSON format specifying the piecewise-linear curves
; for various systems, Xray voltages and gamma energies.
; keywords below select the curve accordingly.
; A sample file is currently located in the source of STIR
; (currently available at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UCL/STIR/f69bfc0971280901adda2649bf8fe85ac0583a87/src/config/ct_slopes.json)
; This file is installed in your <install_prefix>/share folder
; (use `stir_config --config-dir` to find its location)

      ; gamma energy (defaults to 511 for PET)
      ;target_photon_energy :=
    End HUToMu Parameters:=

  ; Some smoothing of the CT is normally beneficial for PET.
  ; The amount of smoothing is scanner specific though, and
  ; also depends on any downsampling and
  ; resolution recovery used in the projector
