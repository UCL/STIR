  <h1>Summary of changes in STIR release 6.4</h1>


  <h2>Overall summary</h2>

    <p>
      This version is 100% backwards compatible with STIR 6.3, aside from three important bug fixes,
      which will change results (see below).
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a release with many new features, as listed below. Highlights are
      <ul>

      </ul>
      But there are many other changes from other contibutors as well, see below.
      Of course, there is also the usual code-cleanup and some improvements to the documentation.
      Overall overview and release management was by Kris Thielemans (UCL) with help
      from Daniel Deidda (NPL).

  <h3>Build system</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Several libraries were merged into one library (called <code>stir_buildblock</code>,
      but this might change in the future). This avoids
      circular dependencies between libraries, and should therefore avoid linking problems
      in external projects. It could also make it possible to enable shared libraries
      (not recommended yet).<br>
      This change should be transparent to the developer of external projects, as long as the
      <code>${STIR_LIBRARIES}</code> CMake variable is used, as previously already recommended
      (see the STIR-UsersGuide). However, developers that extend STIR via the <code>STIR_LOCAL</code>
      mechanism might have to change their STIR library dependencies (see the
      <a href=https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1658>PR</a> for details).
      <br>
      <a href=https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1658>PR #1658</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      Use the CMake <code>HDF5::HDF5</code> target to specify dependencies on,
      as opposed to <code>HDF5_CXX_LIBRARIES</code> etc. This should be more future proof
      and avoids problems with the STIR conda-forge build. (This can be switched of
      with the CMake option <code>USE_HDF5_TARGET=OFF</code>.)
      <br>
      <a href=https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1665>PR #1665</a>
    </li>
</ul>

  <h3>Known problems</h3>
  <p>See <a href=https://github.com/UCL/STIR/labels/bug>our issue tracker</a>.<br>
    An important bug is for the "ray tracing matrix" projector for TOF PET. Oblique
    segments currently have problems, see <a href=https://github.com/UCL/STIR/issues/1537># 1537</a>.
