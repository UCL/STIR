    <h1>Summary of changes in STIR release 5.2</h1>

<p>This version is 100% backwards compatible with STIR 5.0 as far as usage goes. However, there are <b> changes in the output of scatter estimation and ECAT8 normalisation<b>, see below for more information.
</p>
<h2>Overall summary</h2>

<p>Of course, there is also the usual code-cleanup and 
  improvements to the documentation. See also <a href="https://github.com/UCL/STIR/milestone/6">the
    5.2 milestone on GitHub</a>.
</p>
<p>Overall code management and assistance by Kris Thielemans (UCL and ASC).</p>

<h2>Patch release info</h2>
<ul>
  <li> 5.2.0 released ??/??/2023</li>
</ul>

<h2> Summary for end users (also to be read by developers)</h2>

<h3>Bug fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Scatter estimation was setting initial activity image to 1 at set-up, effectively ignoring the initial image, aside from geometric info.</li>
  <li>Setting SPECTUB resolution model with STIR python or SIRF divided slope by 10 in error. The problem did not occur when set using parameter file</li>
</ul>

<h3>Changed functionality</h3>
<ul>
  <li> The ECAT8 normalisation (used for the Siemens mMR) code now takes the 4th component <i>axial effects</i> into account.
    These normalisation factors are therefore different (even up to ~10%). This gives improved axial uniformity in the images.
    The use of the axial effects can be switched off by adding setting <tt>use_axial_effects_factors:=0</tt> to the
    parameter file (see an example in <tt>examples/Siemens-mMR/correct_projdata_no_axial_effects.par</tt>), or the class member
    of the same name.<br />
    In addition, the Siemens normalisation header is now read (using a new class <code>InterfileNormHeaderSiemens</code>) such that
    hard-coded variables for the Siemens mMR have been removed. Further testing of this functionality is still required however.
    <br /><a href="https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1182/">PR #1182</a>.
  </li>
  <li>Interfile header parsing now correctly identifies keywords that contain a colon by checking for <tt>:=</tt>./li>
</ul>

<h3>New functionality</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The <tt>Discretised Shape3D</tt> shape/ROI has now an extra value <tt>label index</tt>. For ROIs, this allows
    using a single volume with multiple ROIs encoded as labels, such as output by ITKSnap and many others.
    When used as a shape in <tt>generate_image</tt>, it could be used to extract a single ROI from such a label image.
    <br /><a href="https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1196/">PR #1196</a>.
  </li>
  <li>Global variables in SPECTUB have been substituted by class members, such that multiple SPECTUB projectors can be used.
    <br /><a href="https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1169/">PR #1169</a>.
  </li>
  <li>Global variables in PinholeSPECTUB have been substituted by class members, such that multiple PinholeSPECTUB projectors can be used.
    <br /><a href="https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1212/">PR #1212</a>.
  </li>
  <li>Scatter estimation is now smoothed in axial direction for BlocksOnCylindrical scanners.
    <br /><a href="https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1172/">PR #1172</a>.
  </li>
  <li><code>InverseSSRB</code> now works for BlocksOnCylindrical after a rewrite.
    <br /><a href="https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1172/">PR #1172</a>.
/  </li>
  <li>Parallelised function <code>set_fan_data_add_gaps_help</code> across segments to reduce computation time.
    <br /><a href="https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1168/">PR #1168</a>.
  </li>
  <li>New utility <tt>SPECT_dicom_to_interfile</tt> which reads a DICOM file with SPECT projection data and extracts the data and writes one or more Interfile 3.3 headers
    (still somewhat preliminary).
    <br /><a href="https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1182/">PR #1182</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    The new <tt>stir_timings</tt> utility  is mostly useful for developers,
    but you could use it to optimise the number of OpenMP threads to use for your data.
    <br /><a href="https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1237/">PR #1237</a>.
  </li>
  <li>New classes <code>SegmentIndices</code>, <code>ViewgramIndices</code> and <code>SinogramIndices</code>, used by <code>ProjData</code> related classes, as opposed
    to having to specify all the elements directly, e.g. in C++
    <pre>
      auto sinogram = proj_data.get_sinogram(sinogram_indices);
    </pre>
    This makes these functions more future proof, in particular for TOF. The older functions are now deprecated.
    Note that as <code>Bin</code> is now derived from <code>ViewgramIndices</code>, instantations of <code>Bin</code> can now be used to specify the indices as well in most places.
    <br/>
    There is still more work to do here, mostly related to the symmetries.
    <br /><a href="https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1273/">PR #1273</a>.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Python (and MATLAB)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Examples use <code>stir.ProjData.read_from_file</code> as opposed to <code>stir.ProjData_read_from_file</code>. The former is supported since SWIG 3.0, and the <a href="https://swig.org/Doc4.1/Python.html#Python_nn20">default from SWIG 4.1</a>.
  </li>
  <li>Addition of <code>DetectionPosition</code> and <code>DetectionPositionPair</code>.</li>
  <li><code>bin.time_frame_num</code> is now no longer a function in Python, but acts like a variable
    (as the other <code>Bin</code> members).
  </li>
  <li>Addition of <code>RadionuclideDB</code></li>
</ul>

<h3>New examples</h3>
<ul>
  <li><tt>examples/python/construct_projdata_demo.py</tt> illustrates constructing a <code>ProjDataInMemory</code></li>
</ul>

<h3>Changed functionality</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Scatter estimation was resetting the  activity image to 1 before each iteration. This led to cases where the reconstructed image (and therefore the scatter estimation)
  did not converge, especially when using a small number of sub-iterations.
   Now, the reconstructed image is continuouslu updated between scatter iterations by default. This should also allow users to use less sub-iterations, therefore saving some time for the scatter estimation.
   The old behaviour can be re-enabled by setting <code>restart_reconstruction_every_scatter_iteration</code>
   to true either via a parameter file or via the <code>set_restart_reconstruction_every_scatter_iteration()</code> function.
   <br /><a href="https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1160/">PR #1160</a>. 
  </li>
  <li>energy resolution functions and keywords have now more documentation. <code>Scanner::check_consistency</code> also checks if the energy resolution is less than 20 (as it is FWHM/reference_energy).
  <br /><a href="https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1149/">PR #1149</a>.
  </li>
  <li>Errors now throw <code>std::runtime_error</code> instead of <code>std::string</code>.
  <br /><a href="https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1131/">PR #1131</a>.
  </li>
  <li>The parameter <code>use_view_offset</code> was removed from the <code>interpolate_projdata</code> functions. View-offset is now always taken into account.
  <br /><a href="https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1172/">PR #1172</a>.
  </li>
  <li>The info, warning and error calls are thread safe now (which makes them slower), and the logging output in <code>distributable.cxx</code> was changed from verbosity 2 (which is the STIR default) to verbosity 3.
    This is to reduce the default output during iterative reconstructions.
  <br /><a href="https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1243/">PR #1243</a>.
  </li>
  <li>The <code>Succeeded</code> class has a new method <code>bool succeeded()</code> enabling more concise code (avoiding the need for comparing with <code>Succeeded::yes</code> which is especially verbose in Python).
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Deprecated functionality</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The following functions (previously used for upsampling the scatter estimate) have been
    made obsolete or replaced, and will be removed in STIR version 6.0.0: <code>interpolate_axial_position</code>, <code>extend_sinogram_in_views</code> and <code>extend_segment_in_views</code>
  </li>
  <li>Constructors/functions in <code>ProjData</code> related classes that explicitly use <code>axial_pos_num</code>, <code>view_num</code> etc in their arguments are now deprecated,
    and should be replaced by their respective versions that use <code>SegmentIndices</code>, <code>ViewgramIndices</code> or <code>SinogramIndices</code>. The former will not be
    compatible with TOF information that will be introduced in version 6.0.0.
  </li>
  <li>STIR version 6.0.0 will likely require C++ 14 (currently we require C++ 11, but already support C++ 20).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Build system and dependencies</h3>
<ul>
  <li>CMake 3.12 is now required on Windows. (It will be required on all platforms in the next version).</li>
  <li>We now use CMake's <a href=https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/community/-/wikis/doc/tutorials/Object-Library>OBJECT library feature</a> for the registries. This avoids re-compilation of the registries for every executable and therefore speeds-up building time. Use of STIR in an external project is not affected as long as the recommended practice was followed. This is now documented in the User's Guide.
    <br /><a href="https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1141/">PR #1141</a>.
  </li>
  <li>The <code>error</code> and <code>warning</code> functions are now no longer included from <code>common.h</code> and need to be included manually when used (as was already the case for <code>#include "stir/info.h"</code>).
    <br /><a href="https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1192/">PR #1192</a>.
  </li>
  <li>add .h and .i as dependencies for SWIG generated wrappers to make sure they get rebuild.
    (Currently adding all .h files, which is too much, but CMake needs a fix before we can do
    this properly).
    <br /><a href="https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1218/">PR #1218</a>.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Changes for developers</h3>
<ul>
  <li>moved all functionality in <code>CListEventCylindricalScannerWithDiscreteDetectors</code> to template class
    <code>CListEventScannerWithDiscreteDetectors</code> (templated in <code>ProjDataInfoT</code>). This enables
    re-use for generic/blocksoncylindrical scanners.
    <br /><a href="https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1222/">PR #1222</a>.
  </li>
  <li>rewritten <code>ProjDataInMemory</code> to avoid streams, causing a speed-up of some
    operations, and removing a limit of total size of 2GB.
    <br /><a href="https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1260/">PR #1260</a>.
  </li>
</ul>


<h3>Known problems</h3>
<ul>
<li>See <a href=https://github.com/UCL/STIR/labels/bug>our issue tracker</a>.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Minor (?) bug fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Small change in scatter simulation to how non-arccorrected bins are computed. Added a check in the construction of non-arccorrected projdata that the number of tangential bins is not larger than the maximum non-arccorrected bins.
    <br /><a href="https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1152/">PR #1152</a>.
  </li>
  <li><code>extend_segment_in_views</code> does not handle view offsets correctly and does not work for BlocksOnCylindrical scanners <br /><a href="https://github.com/UCL/STIR/issues/1177/">issue #1177</a>. A new function <code>extend_segment</code> was added that works for Cylindrical and BlocksOnCylindrical and allows extension in tangential and axial direction as well.
    <br /><a href="https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1172/">PR #1172</a>.
  </li>
  <li><code>sample_function_on_regular_grid</code> did not handle offset correctly in all places <br /><a href="https://github.com/UCL/STIR/issues/1178/">issue #1178</a>.
    <br /><a href="https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1172/">PR #1172</a>.
  </li>
  <li>Ray tracing projection for BlocksOnCylindrical scanner geometries contained a bug where some bins were swapped across oblique segments <br /><a href="https://github.com/UCL/STIR/issues/1223/">issue #1223</a>. This sometimes lead to large artifacts in reconstructions.
    <br /><a href="https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1231/">PR #1231</a>.
