    <h1>Summary of changes in STIR release 5.2</h1>

<p>This version is 100% backwards compatible with STIR 5.0. However, there is a <b> change in the output of scatter estimation<b>, see below for more information.
</p>
<h2>Overall summary</h2>

<p>Of course, there is also the usual code-cleanup and 
  improvements to the documentation. See also <a href="https://github.com/UCL/STIR/milestone/6">the
    5.2 milestone on GitHub</a>.
</p>
<p>Overall code management and assistance by Kris Thielemans (UCL and ASC).</p>

<h2>Patch release info</h2>
<ul>
  <li> 5.2.0 released ??/??/2023</li>
</ul>

<h2> Summary for end users (also to be read by developers)</h2>

<h3>Bug fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Scatter estimation was setting initial activity image to 1 at set-up, effectively ignoring the initial image, aside from geometric info.</li>
</ul>

<h3>New functionality</h3>
<ul>
</ul>

<h3>New examples</h3>
<ul>
</ul>

<h4>Python</h4>
<ul>
</ul>

<h3>Changed functionality</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Scatter estimation was resetting the  activity image to 1 before each iteration. This led to cases where the reconstructed image (and therefore the scatter estimation)
  did not converge, especially when using a small number of sub-iterations.
   Now, the reconstructed image is continuouslu updated between scatter iterations by default. This should also allow users to use less sub-iterations, therefore saving some time for the scatter estimation.
   The old behaviour can be re-enabled by setting <code>restart_reconstruction_every_scatter_iteration</code>
   to true either via a parameter file or via the <code>set_restart_reconstruction_every_scatter_iteration()</code> function.
   <br /><a href="https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1160/">PR #1160</a>. 
  </li>
  <li>energy resolution functions and keywords have now more documentation. <code>Scanner::check_consistency</code> also checks if the energy resolution is less than 20 (as it is FWHM/reference_energy).
  <br /><a href="https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1149/">PR #1149</a>.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Build system and dependencies</h3>
<ul>
  <li>We now use CMake's <a href=https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/community/-/wikis/doc/tutorials/Object-Library>OBJECT library feature</a> for the registries. This avoids re-compilation of the registries for every executable and therefore speeds-up building time. Use of STIR in an external project is not affected as long as the recommended practice was followed. This is now documented in the User's Guide.

<h3>Known problems</h3>

<li>See <a href=https://github.com/UCL/STIR/labels/bug>our issue tracker</a>.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Minor (?) bug fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Small change in scatter simulation to how non-arccorrected bins are computed. Added a check in the construction of non-arccorrected projdata that the number of tangential bins is not larger than the maximum non-arccorrected bins.
