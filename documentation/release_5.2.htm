    <h1>Summary of changes in STIR release 5.2</h1>

<p>This version is 100% backwards compatible with STIR 5.0.
</p>
<h2>Overall summary</h2>

<p>Of course, there is also the usual code-cleanup and 
  improvements to the documentation. See also <a href="https://github.com/UCL/STIR/milestone/6">the
    5.2 milestone on GitHub</a>.
</p>
<p>Overall code management and assistance by Kris Thielemans (UCL and ASC).</p>

<h2>Patch release info</h2>
<ul>
  <li> 5.2.0 released ??/??/2023</li>
</ul>

<h2> Summary for end users (also to be read by developers)</h2>

<h3>Bug fixes</h3>
<ul>
</ul>

<h3>New functionality</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Scatter estimation is now smoothed in axial direction for BlocksOnCylindrical scanners.
    <br /><a href="https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1172/">PR #1172</a>.
  </li>
  <li><code>InverseSSRB</code> now works for BlocksOnCylindrical after a rewrite.
    <br /><a href="https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1172/">PR #1172</a>.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>New examples</h3>
<ul>
</ul>

<h4>Python</h4>
<ul>
</ul>

<h3>Changed functionality</h3>
<ul>
  <li>energy resolution functions and keywords have now more documentation. <code>Scanner::check_consistency</code> also checks if the energy resolution is less than 20 (as it is FWHM/reference_energy).
  <br /><a href="https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1149/">PR #1149</a>.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Build system and dependencies</h3>
<ul>
  <li>We now use CMake's <a href=https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/community/-/wikis/doc/tutorials/Object-Library>OBJECT library feature</a> for the registries. This avoids re-compilation of the registries for every executable and therefore speeds-up building time. Use of STIR in an external project is not affected as long as the recommended practice was followed. This is now documented in the User's Guide.
    <br /><a href="https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1141/">PR #1141</a>.
  </li>
</ul>


<h3>Known problems</h3>
<ul>
<li>See <a href=https://github.com/UCL/STIR/labels/bug>our issue tracker</a>.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Minor (?) bug fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Small change in scatter simulation to how non-arccorrected bins are computed. Added a check in the construction of non-arccorrected projdata that the number of tangential bins is not larger than the maximum non-arccorrected bins.
    <br /><a href="https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1152/">PR #1152</a>.
  </li>
  <li><code>extend_segment_in_views</code> does not handle view offsets correctly and does not work for BlocksOnCylindrical scanners <br /><a href="https://github.com/UCL/STIR/issues/1177/">issue #1177</a>. A new function <code>extend_segment</code> was added that works for Cylindrical and BlocksOnCylindrical and allows extension in tangential and axial direction as well.
    <br /><a href="https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1172/">PR #1172</a>.
  </li>
  <li><code>sample_function_on_regular_grid</code> did not handle offset correctly in all places <br /><a href="https://github.com/UCL/STIR/issues/1178/">issue #1178</a>.
    <br /><a href="https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1172/">PR #1172</a>.
