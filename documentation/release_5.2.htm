    <h1>Summary of changes in STIR release 5.2</h1>

<p>This version is 100% backwards compatible with STIR 5.0. However, there is a <b> change in the output of scatter estimation<b>, see below for more information.
</p>
<h2>Overall summary</h2>

<p>Of course, there is also the usual code-cleanup and 
  improvements to the documentation. See also <a href="https://github.com/UCL/STIR/milestone/6">the
    5.2 milestone on GitHub</a>.
</p>
<p>Overall code management and assistance by Kris Thielemans (UCL and ASC).</p>

<h2>Patch release info</h2>
<ul>
  <li> 5.2.0 released ??/??/2023</li>
</ul>

<h2> Summary for end users (also to be read by developers)</h2>

<h3>Bug fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Scatter estimation was setting initial activity image to 1 at set-up, effectively ignoring the initial image, aside from geometric info.</li>
</ul>

<h3>New functionality</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Scatter estimation is now smoothed in axial direction for BlocksOnCylindrical scanners.
    <br /><a href="https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1172/">PR #1172</a>.
  </li>
  <li><code>InverseSSRB</code> now works for BlocksOnCylindrical after a rewrite.
    <br /><a href="https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1172/">PR #1172</a>.
/  </li>
  <li>Parallelised function <code>set_fan_data_add_gaps_help</code> across segments to reduce computation time.
    <br /><a href="https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1168/">PR #1168</a>.
  </li>
  <li>New utility <tt>SPECT_dicom_to_interfile</tt> which reads a DICOM file with SPECT projection data and extracts the data and writes one or more Interfile 3.3 headers
    (still somewhat preliminary).
    <br /><a href="https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1182/">PR #1182</a>.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>New examples</h3>
<ul>
</ul>

<h4>Python</h4>
<ul>
</ul>

<h3>Changed functionality</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Scatter estimation was resetting the  activity image to 1 before each iteration. This led to cases where the reconstructed image (and therefore the scatter estimation)
  did not converge, especially when using a small number of sub-iterations.
   Now, the reconstructed image is continuouslu updated between scatter iterations by default. This should also allow users to use less sub-iterations, therefore saving some time for the scatter estimation.
   The old behaviour can be re-enabled by setting <code>restart_reconstruction_every_scatter_iteration</code>
   to true either via a parameter file or via the <code>set_restart_reconstruction_every_scatter_iteration()</code> function.
   <br /><a href="https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1160/">PR #1160</a>. 
  </li>
  <li>energy resolution functions and keywords have now more documentation. <code>Scanner::check_consistency</code> also checks if the energy resolution is less than 20 (as it is FWHM/reference_energy).
  <br /><a href="https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1149/">PR #1149</a>.
  </li>
  <li>Errors now throw <code>std::runtime_error</code> instead of <code>std::string</code>.
  <br /><a href="https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1131/">PR #1131</a>.
  </li>
  <li>The parameter <code>use_view_offset</code> was removed from the <code>interpolate_projdata</code> functions. View-offset is now always taken into account.
  <br /><a href="https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1172/">PR #1172</a>.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Deprecated functionality</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The following functions (previously used for upsampling the scatter estimate) have been
    made obsolete or replaced, and will be removed in STIR version 6.0.0: <code>interpolate_axial_position</code>, <code>extend_sinogram_in_views</code> and <code>extend_segment_in_views</code>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Build system and dependencies</h3>
<ul>
  <li>We now use CMake's <a href=https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/community/-/wikis/doc/tutorials/Object-Library>OBJECT library feature</a> for the registries. This avoids re-compilation of the registries for every executable and therefore speeds-up building time. Use of STIR in an external project is not affected as long as the recommended practice was followed. This is now documented in the User's Guide.
    <br /><a href="https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1141/">PR #1141</a>.
  </li>
  <li>The <code>error</code> and <code>warning</code> functions are now no longer included from <code>common.h</code> and need to be included manually when used (as was already the case for <code>#include "stir/info.h"</code>).
    <br /><a href="https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1192/">PR #1192</a>.
  </li>
</ul>


<h3>Known problems</h3>
<ul>
<li>See <a href=https://github.com/UCL/STIR/labels/bug>our issue tracker</a>.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Minor (?) bug fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Small change in scatter simulation to how non-arccorrected bins are computed. Added a check in the construction of non-arccorrected projdata that the number of tangential bins is not larger than the maximum non-arccorrected bins.
    <br /><a href="https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1152/">PR #1152</a>.
  </li>
  <li><code>extend_segment_in_views</code> does not handle view offsets correctly and does not work for BlocksOnCylindrical scanners <br /><a href="https://github.com/UCL/STIR/issues/1177/">issue #1177</a>. A new function <code>extend_segment</code> was added that works for Cylindrical and BlocksOnCylindrical and allows extension in tangential and axial direction as well.
    <br /><a href="https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1172/">PR #1172</a>.
  </li>
  <li><code>sample_function_on_regular_grid</code> did not handle offset correctly in all places <br /><a href="https://github.com/UCL/STIR/issues/1178/">issue #1178</a>.
    <br /><a href="https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1172/">PR #1172</a>.
