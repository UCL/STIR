    <h1>Future developments</h1>

<p>The STIR library, in its current state, possesses many
capabilities, but some desirable developments would be:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Expanded library of polymorphic classes (e.g. image grids, and 
ordered subsets)</li>
<li> Additional data formats support, without conversion to Interfile.</li>
<li> More projectors </li>
<li> More priors </li>
<li> Additional scanners</li>
<li> Allow images of arbitrary size in z-direction as well.</li>
<li> Allow x,y offset in images (at least for some projectors)</li>
</ul>

<p>However, which feature is actually finalised/implemented
depends on the needs of the developers. If you want one of these
features and are willing to help, let us know.
