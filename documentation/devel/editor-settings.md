# Developer documentation: editor settings

White-spaces and indentation with multiple developers are a pain. Please adhere to
our white-space policy, which we enforce via [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/), including
running of [clang-format](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html).
See [git-hooks.md](git-hooks.md) for more information.

Developer experience will be best if you set your editor/IDE to use the same settings,
including versions of the formatters (`clang-format` in particular).
