    <h1>Summary of changes in STIR release 6.1</h1>

    <p>
      This version is 100% backwards compatible with STIR 6.0 for the user, except for the bug-fix in the RDP (see below).
    </p>

<h2>Overall summary</h2>
    <p>
      This version adds capability of using Parallelproj (CPU and GPU versions) for TOF data. In addition,
      the list-mode objective function has several improvements, including speed-up by using multi-threading
      if caching was not enabled.
    </p>

    <p>
      Of course, there is also the usual code-cleanup and improvements to the documentation.
    </p>

    <p>
      This release contains mainly code written by Nicole Jurjew (UCL) and Kris Thielemans (UCL).
    </p>

<h2> Summary for end users (also to be read by developers)</h2>


<h3>New functionality</h3>
<ul>
<li>
  Add TOF capability of the parallelproj projector (see <a href=https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1356>PR #1356</a>)
</li>
<li>
  It is now possible to read TOF bin order from the interfile header (see <a href=https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1389> PR #1389</a>)
</li>
<li>
  <code>PoissonLogLikelihoodWithLinearModelForMeanAndListModeDataWithProjMatrixByBin</code> can now compute the value
  as well as <code>accumulate_Hessian_times_input</code>.
  <br>
  <a href=https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1418> PR #1418</a>
</li>
<li>
  <code>GeneralisedObjectiveFunction</code> has 2 new members to compute the full gradient
  (<code>compute_gradient</code> and <code>compute_gradient_without_penalty</code>). Previously,
  only subset gradients were available.
  <br>
  <a href=https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1418> PR #1418</a>
</li>
</ul>


<h3>Changed functionality</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <code>PoissonLogLikelihoodWithLinearModelForMeanAndListModeDataWithProjMatrixByBin</code> now computes the gradient
    multi-threaded (if OpenMP is enabled), even if caching to file of the list-mode file is not enabled.
    <br>
    <a href=https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1418> PR #1418</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    Accumulation in computation of priors now uses doubles, which could result in slightly better precision. <a href=https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1410>Part of PR #1410</a>.
  </li>
</ul>


<h3>Bug fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The <strong>Relative Difference Prior gave incorrect results</strong>, probably since switching to C++-14 in version 6.0, although we are not sure.
    See <a href=https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1410>PR #1410</a> and associated <a href=https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1409>issue #1409</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
      Our checks for determining system byte-order were out-of-date and in particular did not work on MacOS 14 on ARM.
      We now use CMake's <code>CMAKE_CXX_BYTE_ORDER</code> (available since CMake 3.20). This could potentially affect reading of list-mode data
      (which would otherwise be garbled).
      <br>
      Fixed in <a href=https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1412>PR #1412</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    The listmode objective function did not loop over TOF bins when computing the Hessian. This would give different results in OSSPS
    for computing the "denominator".
    <br>
    Fixed in <a href=https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1427>issue #1427</a>.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Known problems</h3>
    <p>See <a href=https://github.com/UCL/STIR/labels/bug>our issue tracker</a>.</p>


<H2>What's new for developers (aside from what should be obvious
from the above):</H2>

<h3>Backward incompatibities</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Additional checks on <code>GeometryBlocksOnCylindrical</code> scanner configuration, which may lead to an
        error being raised, while previously the code silently proceeded.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Bug fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <code>PoissonLogLikelihoodWithLinearModelForMeanAndProjData</code> had a (minor?) problem with TOF data
    that when computing the gradient, the normalisation object was not set-up with the TOF data,
    but non-TOF instead. This did not happen in our normal reconstruction code, and would have thrown an error
    if it occured.
    <br>
    Fixed in <a href=https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1427>issue #1427</a>.
  </li>
</ul>


<h3>Other code changes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Fixes an incompatibility with C++20.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Build system</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Force C++ version according to CERN ROOT versions: ROOT 6.28.10 needs C++17 and 6.30.2 needs C++20.
    Also some fixes when relying on <code>root-config</code>.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Test changes</h3>

<h4>C++ tests</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Objective functions (both projection-data and list-mode) and priors now have a numerical test for <code>accumulate_Hessian_times_input</code>
    <br>
    <a href=https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1418> PR #1418</a>
  </li>
</ul>
