    <h1>Summary of changes in STIR release 6.2</h1>

    <p>
      This version is 100% backwards compatible with STIR 6.1. However, C++-17 is now required.
    </p>

<h2>Overall summary</h2>
    <p>
     
    </p>

    <p>
      Of course, there is also the usual code-cleanup and improvements to the documentation.
    </p>

    <p>
      This release contains mainly code written by Nicole Jurjew (UCL) and Kris Thielemans (UCL).
    </p>

<h2> Summary for end users (also to be read by developers)</h2>


<h3>New functionality</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <code>ProjData</code> now has most of the methods for numerical operations as <code>Array</code>,
    i.e. +=,-=,*=,/=,<code>find_max()</code>,<code>find_min()</code>,<code>sum()</code>.
    <code>ProjDataInMemory</code> adds =,-,*,/ (as well as overloads that are faster than the implementations
    in <code>ProjData</code>).<br>
    <a href=https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1439>PR #1439</a> and <a href=https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1448>PR #1448</a>
  </li>
</ul>


<h3>Changed functionality</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <code>Array::sum()</code> (and hence images etc) now accumulates in a variable at higher precision to avoid loss of precision.<br>
    <a href=https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1439>PR #1439</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>PoissonLogLikelihoodWithLinearModelForMeanAndProjData</code> now attempts to auto-detect
    if it should compute sensitivity using TOF back-projection or not. It does this by
    checking if its normalisation object can only handle TOF data or not.
    This should mean that the <tt>use time-of-flight sensitivities</tt> keyword should now
    rarely (if ever) be necessary.
    <br>
    <a href=https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1458>PR #1458</a>
    </li>
</ul>


<h3>Bug fixes</h3>

</ul>

<h3>Build system</h3>
<ul
  <li>
    C++-17 is now required.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Known problems</h3>
    <p>See <a href=https://github.com/UCL/STIR/labels/bug>our issue tracker</a>.</p>


<H2>What's new for developers (aside from what should be obvious
from the above):</H2>

<h3>Changed functionality</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
      <code>Array</code> classes by default use contiguous memory allocation (as opposed to a sequence of 1D vectors).
      This could speed up memory allocation and destruction of arrays with a high number of underlying 1D vectors. It also allows reading/writing
      data in one call to the C++ library, as opposed to many small calls. Also added move constructors to the <code>Array</code>,
      <code>VectorWithOffset</code> classes.
      <br>
      <a href=https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1236>PR #1236</a> and <a href=https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1438>PR #1438</a>.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Bug fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <code>PoissonLogLikelihoodWithLinearModelForMeanAndProjData</code> had a (minor?) problem with TOF data
    that when computing the gradient, the normalisation object was not set-up with the TOF data,
    but non-TOF instead. This did not happen in our normal reconstruction code, and would have thrown an error
    if it occured.
    <br>
    Fixed in <a href=https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1427>PR #1427</a>.
  </li>
</ul>


<h3>Other code changes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Fixed an incompatibility with C++20.
  </li>
  <li>
    Enabled OpenMP for <code>Array</code> members <code>find_max(), find_min(), sum(), sum_positivie()</code>.
    <br>
    <a href=https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1449>PR #1449</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Changes to allow reading Siemens Biograph Vision data: iSSRB and SSRB are now included in the SWIG interface; minor changes to a shell script altering e7tools headers.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Build system</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Force C++ version according to CERN ROOT versions: ROOT 6.28.10 needs C++17 and 6.30.2 needs C++20.
    Also some fixes when relying on <code>root-config</code>.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Test changes</h3>

<h4>C++ tests</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Objective functions (both projection-data and list-mode) and priors now have a numerical test for <code>accumulate_Hessian_times_input</code>
    <br>
    <a href=https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1418> PR #1418</a>
  </li>
</ul>
