    <h1>Summary of changes in STIR release 4.1.0 (dated ?/?/2020)</h1>
<h2>Overall summary</h2>

    <p>
    </p>
    
    <p>This release contains mainly code written by
      <ul>
        <li>Kris Thielemans (UCL) for general overview, fixes, help and maintenance</li>
        <li>Richard Brown (UCL) for wrapping of NiftyPET's GPU functionality for projecting and unlisting</li>
        <li>Robert Twyman (UCL) for Relative Difference Prior and computation of the log-likelihood modification</li>  
      </ul>
    </p>

<h2> Summary for end users (also to be read by developers)</h2>


<h3>New functionality</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Addition of the Relative Difference Prior [J. Nuyts, et al., 2002].
  </li>
  <li>NiftyPET's GPU projectors have been wrapped. If NiftyPET is installed, these projectors can be used 
    on data from the Siemens mMR. See the example parameter file in <tt>examples/samples/OSMAPOSL_NiftyPET.par</tt>.
    NiftyPET's GPU-accelerated unlisting has also been wrapped, also allowing for randoms estimation and norm extraction.
  </li>
</ul>


<h3>Changed functionality</h3>
<ul>
<li>  Modification of log-likelihood computation to use more doubles, improving numerical stability, see <a href="https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/528">PR 528</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Python (and MATLAB) interface</h4>
none



<h3>Known problems</h3>
<p>See the Github issues for more information.</p>
<ul>
<li>SPECT related
 <ul>
 <li> Do NOT use current PET projectors on SPECT Data. You will have to choose the "SPECT UB" projector 
    in all cases (see the sample .par files).</li>
 <li>The quantitative scale of reconstructed SPECT images is generally different than for PET reconstructions.
    It probably also behaves differently than the PET projectors when using different voxel sizes.</li>
 <li>Images are still written as PET Interfile (but this is ignored when reading).</li>
 <li>At present, the collimator model varies the width of the PSF linearly with distance. This was
   experimentally verified with some collimators (for normal distances to the collimator).
   However, we need to add the possibility to use different models.
  </li>
  <li><tt>list_projdata_info</tt> still reports SPECT data as if it's a PET scanner, but you can see
    all necessary geometric info from it anyway.</li>
  <li><tt>create_projdata_template</tt> only works for PET scanners. For SPECT, you could take the 
   sample Interfile header, modify it to your needs (and create an empty file for the binary data pointed to
   by the Interfile header).
  </li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>Building with shared libraries is currently broken on many (all?) systems due to inter-dependencies between libraries.</li>
<li>This release is known to fail when both MPI and shared libraries are enabled. You will see linking errors in all non_MPI executables.</li>
<li>The incremental interpolating back-projector still gives problems in the centre of the images
on some architectures/compiler/optimisation settings. We recommend to use the ray-tracing
matrix (with additional rays) instead.</li>
<li>When using <code>GRAPHICS=X</code> (i.e. on Unix/Linux/MacOSX) the window displaying
the bitmaps is sometimes empty. This might depend on your X server settings.
This affects <tt>manip_image</tt>, <tt>manip_projdata</tt> and <tt>display_projdata</tt>. 
We have currently no work-around (aside from using <code>GRAPHICS=PGM</code> or
<tt>stir_write_pgm</tt>).
