<h2> Summary for end users (also to be read by developers)</h2>


<h3>New functionality</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Reading of GE HDF5 data (GE fileformat RDF 9) for the GE Signa PET/MR and recent GE PET/CT scanners (but depending on their
    software version).
    We currently read listmode, sinograms and calibration files.
    This code is TOF-ready, but TOF is not enabled pending merge of the TOF Pull Request. Therefore, all reconstructions
    will be non-TOF.
  </li>
  <li>A new script <tt>create_fdef_from_listmode.sh</tt> that can be used to create a single-time
    frame definition file for a given listmode file.
  <li>
    Addition of the Relative Difference Prior [J. Nuyts, et al., 2002].
  </li>
  <li>NiftyPET's GPU projectors have been wrapped. If NiftyPET is installed, these projectors can be used 
    on data from the Siemens mMR. See the example parameter file in <tt>examples/samples/OSMAPOSL_NiftyPET.par</tt>.
    NiftyPET's GPU-accelerated unlisting has also been wrapped, also allowing for randoms estimation and norm extraction.
  </li>
  <li><tt>estimate_triple_energy_window_scatter_sinogram</tt> can use different width for the upper and lower energy windows</li>
  <li><tt>stir_math</tt> now supports the <tt>--output-format</tt> option for dyanmic and parametric images as well. (An example
  file using the <tt>Multi</tt> format is given in the <tt>examples/samples</tt> folder).</li>
  <li>Interfile and ITK image IO now understand some date/time fields. This required a change to our Interfile
    version specification to be able to handle time-zones. These can now be added via the same suffix as used by DICOM, e.g.
    <tt>10:01:01.00+0130</tt>.<br />
    <strong>Warning:</strong> If the time-zone is not specified, we assume it's in the current time-zone without DST. This is dangerous,
    but allows us to subtract time-fields.</li>
  <li>Added a utility <tt>list_lm_info</tt>.
</ul>


<h3>Changed functionality</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Modification of log-likelihood computation to use more doubles, improving numerical stability, see <a href="https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/528">PR 528</a>.</li>
  <li>Reconstruction algorithms perform now more checks during <code>set_up()</code> etc.
    However, this means that <strong>you have to call <code>set_up()</code> also for analytic
    reconstruction algorithms</strong>. (This was already documented, but not yet enforced).
  </li>
  <li>copy energy information from the template in the <tt>forward_project</tt> utility.
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>Python (and MATLAB) interface</h4>
none



<h3>Known problems</h3>
<p>See the Github issues for more information.</p>
<ul>
<li>SPECT related
 <ul>
 <li> Do NOT use current PET projectors on SPECT Data. You will have to choose the "SPECT UB" projector 
    in all cases (see the sample .par files).</li>
 <li>The quantitative scale of reconstructed SPECT images is generally different than for PET reconstructions.
    It probably also behaves differently than the PET projectors when using different voxel sizes.</li>
 <li>Images are still written as PET Interfile (but this is ignored when reading).</li>
 <li>At present, the collimator model varies the width of the PSF linearly with distance. This was
   experimentally verified with some collimators (for normal distances to the collimator).
   However, we need to add the possibility to use different models.
  </li>
  <li><tt>list_projdata_info</tt> still reports SPECT data as if it's a PET scanner, but you can see
    all necessary geometric info from it anyway.</li>
  <li><tt>create_projdata_template</tt> only works for PET scanners. For SPECT, you could take the 
   sample Interfile header, modify it to your needs (and create an empty file for the binary data pointed to
   by the Interfile header).
  </li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>Building with shared libraries is currently broken on many (all?) systems due to inter-dependencies between libraries.</li>
<li>This release is known to fail when both MPI and shared libraries are enabled. You will see linking errors in all non_MPI executables.</li>
<li>The incremental interpolating back-projector still gives problems in the centre of the images
on some architectures/compiler/optimisation settings. We recommend to use the ray-tracing
matrix (with additional rays) instead.</li>
<li>When using <code>GRAPHICS=X</code> (i.e. on Unix/Linux/MacOSX) the window displaying
the bitmaps is sometimes empty. This might depend on your X server settings.
This affects <tt>manip_image</tt>, <tt>manip_projdata</tt> and <tt>display_projdata</tt>. 
We have currently no work-around (aside from using <code>GRAPHICS=PGM</code> or
<tt>stir_write_pgm</tt>).
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Minor bug fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li>
  Changes to GATE/root cylindrical PET geometry interpretation,
  see <a href="https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/569">PR 569</a>.</li>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Documentation changes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added documentation on new features</li> 
 </ul>

<h3>recon_test_pack changes</h3>
<li>added a test for scatter estimation</li>

<h3>Other changes to tests</h3>
<ul>
    <li>store data in <code>ProjDataInMemory</code> in the same order as what is used by <code>copy_to</code> and <code>fill_from</code>. This enabled using straight-forward copy. (This change should not affect anyone, except if you relied on a specific order in the buffer before.)
    </li>
  <li>C++ tests for consistency of forward projection and reconstruction, executed via <tt>ctest</tt>.
    This is on top of the <tt>recon_test_pack</tt>.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Build system</h3>
<ul>
  <li>To enable the functionality for GE HDF5 files, you will need to first install HDF5 libraries. For most operating systems
    this can be done via your package manager which we highly recommend. You could also
    download from the <a href="https://www.hdfgroup.org/downloads/hdf5/">HDF5 group download page</a>.
  </li>
</ul>
