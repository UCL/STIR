  <h1>Summary of changes in STIR release 6.3</h1>


  <h2>Overall summary</h2>

    <p>
      This version is 100% backwards compatible with STIR 6.2, aside from three important bug fixes,
      which will change results (see below).
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a release with many new features, as listed below. Highlights are
      <ul>
        <li>the new Gibbs penalty hierarchy with CUDA and OpenMP support (and much easier addition of new
          potential functions) (Matteo Neel Colombo, Univ of Milano-Bicocca),
        </li>
        <li>
          new 2D analytic reconstruction algorithms (including two that allow
          quantitative reconstruction of SPECT) (Dimitra Kyriakopoulou, UCL),
        </li>
        <li>
          better Python support including algebraic operations and faster conversion to NumPy arrays
          (Kris Thielemans, UCL),
        </li>
        <li>
          continuous memory storage for arrays (allowing zero-copy
          access to image/projection data in SIRF Python, but not yet in STIR Python)
          (Kris Thielemans, UCL),
        </li>
        <li>
          faster scatter estimation for blocks on cylindrical scanners
          (Markus Jehl, Positrigo),
        </li>
        <li>
          reduced memory usage for iterative reconstructions, avoiding hitting the current limitation
          of 2^31 elements in <code>ProjDataInMemory</code>
          (Kris Thielemans, UCL),
        </li>
        <li>
          Python code for adapting e7tools output for Siemens Vision 600 to STIR
          (Nicole Jurjew, UCL)
        </li>
      </ul>
      But there are many other changes from other contibutors as well, see below.
      Of course, there is also the usual code-cleanup and some improvements to the documentation.
      Overall overview and release management was by Kris Thielemans (UCL) with help
      from Daniel Deidda (NPL).

    <h2>Patch release info</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        6.3.0 released 31/10/2025<br>

  <h2> Summary for end users (also to be read by developers)</h2>


  <h3>New functionality</h3>
  <h4>General</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Several 2D analytic reconstruction algorithms were added for PET (i.e. inverting the 2D Radon transform)
      and parallel beam SPECT (inverting the 2D attenuated Radon transform). The latter
      allow quantitatively correct analytic reconstruction of SPECT data (after scatter correction).
      <ul>
        <li>
          The Spline Reconstruction Technique (SRT) algorithm has been added in 2 different versions:
          <code>SRT2D</code> for PET and <code>SRT2DSPECT</code> for SPECT.
          The reference for the implemented algorithms is:<br>
          Fokas, A. S., A. Iserles, and V. Marinakis.
          <cite>Reconstruction algorithm for single photon emission computed tomography and its numerical
            implementation.</cite>
          Journal of the Royal Society Interface* 3.6 (2006): 45-54.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>GRD2D</code> for PET is a direct Fourier method using regridding with Kaiser-Bessel functions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>DDSR2D</code> for parallel beam SPECT uses Hilbert transforms in projection space.
        </li>
      </ul>
      The reference for the implementation of these algorithms is:<br>
      Dimitra Kyriakopoulou, <cite>Analytical and Numerical Aspects of Tomography</cite>,
      PhD thesis, University College London (UCL), 2024,<br>
      Available at:
      <a href=https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10202525/>discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10202525/</a>.
      <br>
      <a href=https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1420>PR #1420</a> and <a href=https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1595>PR #1595</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Wiener and Gamma filters were added.
      <br>
      <a href=https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1420>PR #1420</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>ScatterSimulation</code> can now downsample the scanner transaxially (crystals per ring) for
      <code>BlocksOnCylindrical</code>,
      scanners, which speeds up <code>ScatterEstimation</code> considerably. By default, downsampling the detectors per
      reading
      is disabled for backwards compatibility.<br>
      <a href=https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1291>PR #1291</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      The priors code has been refactored to provide two common, parallelized base classes for CPU and GPU implementations (<code>GibbsPenalty</code> and <code>CudaGibbsPenalty</code>).<br>
      On CPU, we introduce <code>GibbsQuadraticPenalty</code> and <code>GibbsRelativeDifferencePenalty</code>, which inherit from the parallelized <code>GibbsPenalty</code> base class (now parallelized using OpenMP).<br>
      GPU implementations are also provided as <code>CudaGibbsQuadraticPenalty</code> and <code>CudaGibbsRelativeDifferencePenalty</code>.<br>
      Currently, the new Gibbs penalties are still missing the paraboloidal surrogates related method implementations. They provide two new methods: <code>compute_gradient_times_input</code> and <code>compute_Hessian_diagonal</code>.<br>
      <a href="https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1629">PR #1629</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      Data from GE Discovery MI systems in RDF9 should now be readable. TOF information on these scanners has also been
      added.
      However, projection data is currently still always returned as non-TOF (but list-mode data is read as TOF).<br>
      <a href=https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1503>PR #1503</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      Added the ability to set a forward projector for mask projection in the <code>ScatterEstimation</code> class.<br>
      <a href=https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1530>PR #1530</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      Duration in sinogram interfile/exam_info obtained from <code>LmToProjData</code>/<code>lm_to_projdata</code> has the
      correct value if we unlist all the events. This is not true for ROOT files<br>
      <a href=https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1519>PR #1519</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>LmToProjData</code> class/<code>lm_to_projdata</code> utility now no longer requires a template projection data. If none is
      specified, it will use the proj_data_info from the input list-mode.<br>
      <b>Warning</b> for some scanners with TOF capabilities, this will result in very large projection data (possibly
      larger than the default from the vendor).<br>
      <a href=https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1315>PR #1315</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      Adapt the SPECTUB projector to handle data with only a subset of the views (constructed using <code>ProjData::get_subsets()</code>.
      This is useful for SIRF/CIL applications using stochastic optimisation.<br>
      <a href=https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1596>PR #1596</a>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Python</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      "Container" classes such as <code>FloatVoxelsOnCartesianGrid</code>, <code>ProjDataInMemory</code>
      and array-classes now have numerical operations properly defined, for instance
      <code>a = b + c</code> and <code>a -= 3</code>. Note that <code>a = 1 + b</code> is not
      yet available.<br>
      <a href=https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1630>PR #1630</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      The above "container" classes now have an extra member `as_array()` which returns a numpy <code>ndarray</code>. This
      is equivalent to `stirextra.to_numpy()` which will become deprecated later. In addition, the
      <code>fill()</code> method now directly accepts an <code>ndarray</code>, avoiding the need to go via an iterator.
      These additions also make it easier to prt SIRF python code to STIR.<br>
      <a href=https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1632>PR #1632</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      Added a Python script to convert e7tools generated Siemens Biograph Vision 600 sinograms to STIR compatible format.<br>
      <a href=https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1593>PR #1593</a>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Utilities</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <code>stir_timings</code> has now an extra option to parse a par-file for a projector-pair.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Changed functionality</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      In previous versions, when reading data/images where the radionuclide was not set, a default was used (F18 for
      PET, Tcm99 for SPECT).
      This led to surprising (and sometimes wrong) behaviour. The radionuclide is now kept as "unknown".<br>
      <a href=https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1574>PR #1574</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      Default ECAT scanner configurations updated to use a negative intrinsic tilt.
    </li>
    <li>
      When computing the sensitivity images in <code>PoissonLogLikelihoodWithLinearModelForMeanAndProjData</code>,
      we now avoid creating an extra <code>ProjDataInMemory</code> in most cases (there are still some corner
      cases for TOF data when using non-TOF projector for the sensitivity, but then the memory overhead is small).
      This enables LAFOV PET reconstructions with the "ray tracing" matrix (we use less memory, and we avoid running into a current
      <code>ProjDataInMemory</code> <a href=https://github.com/UCL/STIR/issues/1505> limitation on the number of bins</a>).<br>
      <a href=https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1617>PR #1716</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        Boost format was replaced by `std::format` for formatting strings. If C++20 or newer is
        not yet used, a work-around is in place by using the <a href=https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/>{fmt} library</a>
        (included as as a git submodule).
        Import <code>stir/format.h</code> and then use the <code>format()</code> function to create strings containing various variables. If the format string is not known at compile time,
        use <code>runtime_format()</code> instead.<br>
        Check the updated STIR-developers-overview.
        <br>
        <a href=https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1591>PR #1591</a> and <a href=https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1605>PR #1605</a>
      </li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Changes to examples</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Python example <code>plot_sinogram_profiles.py</code> has been renamed to <code>plot_projdata_profiles.py</code>
      and generalised to work with TOF dimensions etc. A small <code>pytest</code> has been added as well.<br>
      <a href=https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1370>PR #1370</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      Python example <code>ProjDataVisualisation.py</code> now has a vmax slider.<br>
      <a href=https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1568>PR #1568</a>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Bug fixes</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Fixed a bug in the scatter estimation code (introduced in release 5.1.0) if input data is 3D and "cylindrical"
      (there was no bug for "blocksoncylindrical" data).
      The scatter estimation runs on data constructed via SSRB. However, the attenuation correction factors were
      incorrectly obtained with adding of oblique segments (as opposed to averaging).
      This resulted in intermediate images that had the wrong attenuation correction which were approximately
      num_segments times larger. This was compensated by the tail-fitting, but resulted in unexpected scale factors
      (scale factors were around 1/num_segments times what was expected).
      This means that if you used the "min/max scale factor" feature in the scatter estimate, you will have to adjust
      your threshold values. Expected scatter tail-fitting scale factors should now be restored to ~1-1.5 (depending on
      the amount of multiple and out-of-FOV scatter).
      See <a href="https://github.com/UCL/STIR/issues/1532">Issue #1532</a> for more detail. Fixed by using averaging
      functionality of SSRB instead of adding segments for attenuation correction factors.<br>
      <a href=https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1531>PR #1531</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      Fixed a bug in the distributed LM computation code (introduced in 6.1) that neglected to accumulate outputs when
      not built with OpenMP.<br>
      See <a href="https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1566">PR #1566</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Fixed bugs in <code>accumulate_sub_Hessian_times_input</code> and <code>accumulate_sub_Hessian_times_input</code>
      (and hence the non-subset versions) for objective functions when the prior is not zero.<br>
      See <a href="https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1649">PR #1649</a> and <a href="https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1651">PR #1651</a>.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Build system</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Enable more diagnostics in CMake when finding CERN's ROOT (we used to silence them)<br>
      <a href=https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1552>PR #1552</a>
    </li>
    <li>Use OpenMP by default</li>
    <li>Introduce advanced variable <code>MINI_STIR</code> defaulting to <code>OFF</code> for developers.
      This will build a heavily reduced version of STIR which can speed up development time.<br>
      <a href=https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1584>PR #1584</a>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Known problems</h3>
  <p>See <a href=https://github.com/UCL/STIR/labels/bug>our issue tracker</a>.<br>
    An important bug is for the "ray tracing matrix" projector for TOF PET. Oblique
    segments currently have problems, see <a href=https://github.com/UCL/STIR/issues/1537># 1537</a>.
  </p>


  <H2>What is new for developers (aside from what should be obvious from the above):</H2>

  <h3>New functionality</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <code>ProjDataInMemory</code> <code>read_from_file</code> method now returns a <code>ProjDataInMemory</code>
      object.
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>Array::resize</code> and <code>Array::grow</code> argument <code>initialise_with_0</code> usage
      fixed.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Changed functionality</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      In C++, "Container" classes such as <code>VoxelsOnCartesianGrid</code>, <code>ProjDataInMemory</code>
      and array-classes now have numerical operations that return objects of the correct type.
      (Previously, it was a base-class such as <code>NumericVectorWithOffset&lt;Array&lt;2, float&gt;, float&gt;</code>).<br>
      <a href=https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1630>PR #1630</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      Made 2 (deprecated) members of <code>ProjDataInfoBlocksOnCylindricalNoArcCorr</code> <code>private</code>
      and do some clean-up of which files to include.
      <br>
      <a href="https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1556">PR #1556</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>LmToProjData::get_template_proj_data_info_sptr()</code> is now a <code>const</code> member returning
      a <code>shared_ptr&lt;const ProjDataInfo&gt;</code>.<br>
      <a href=https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1315>PR #1315</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      As <code>stir::Array</code> template arguments might change in the future,
      it is now recommended to include <code>stir/ArrayFwd.h</code> when using forward
      declaration and use the <code>ArrayType</code> template-alias in places where
      a rectangular array that might live on a GPU is intended.<br>
      <a href=https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1589>PR #1589</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>Array</code> copy constructor now also uses contiguous memory allocation (as opposed to a sequence of 1D vectors).
      <br>
      <a href=https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1592>PR #1592</a>.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Bug fixes</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Fixed minor incompatibility with gcc-14 and clang-18 by adding an extra include file.<br>
      <a href=https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1552>PR #1552</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      Changed the way that some SWIG work-arounds are implemented, avoiding the SWIG-generated
      wrapper to be compiled with the <code>SWIG</code> preprocessor symbol.<br>
      <a href=https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1647>PR #1647</a>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>New Deprecations and renames</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <code>truncate_end_planes</code> will be removed in v7.0
    </li>
    <li>
      legacy compatibility with version 3, 4 and 5 will be removed in v7.0.
      CMake options <code>STIR_PROJECTORS_AS_V3</code>, <code>STIR_LEGACY_IGNORE_VIEW_OFFSET</code> and
      <code>STIR_ROOT_ROTATION_AS_V4</code> will therefore be removed.
    </li>
    <li>
      Starting from v7.0, <code>GeneralizedPrior</code> will be renamed to <code>GeneralizedPenalty</code>.<br>
      <code>QuadraticPrior</code>, <code>RelativeDifferencePrior</code>, and <code>LogcoshPrior</code> will be removed in favor of the new <code>GibbsPenalty</code> framework.
      <a href=https://github.com/UCL/STIR/issues/1426>Issue #1426</a>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Test changes</h3>
  <p>All new features and most code changes were accompanied by new tests.</p>
