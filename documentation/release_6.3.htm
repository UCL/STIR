    <h1>Summary of changes in STIR release 6.3</h1>


<h2>Overall summary</h2>


<h2>Patch release info</h2>


<h2> Summary for end users (also to be read by developers)</h2>


<h3>New functionality</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    The analytic Spline Reconstruction Technique (SRT) algorithm has been added in 2 different versions: for PET
    (inverting the 2D Radon transform) and for SPECT (inverting the 2D attenuated Radon transform). The latter
    allows quantitatively correct analytic reconstruction of SPECT data (after scatter correction).

    The reference for the implemented algorithms is:<br>
    Fokas, A. S., A. Iserles, and V. Marinakis.
    <cite>Reconstruction algorithm for single photon emission computed tomography and its numerical implementation.</cite>
    Journal of the Royal Society Interface* 3.6 (2006): 45-54.
    <br>
    The reference for the implementation is:<br>
    Dimitra Kyriakopoulou, <cite>Analytical and Numerical Aspects of Tomography</cite>, UCL PhD thesis, (not yet publically accessible)
    <br>
    <a href=https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1420>PR #1420</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>ScatterSimulation</code> can now downsample the scanner transaxially (crystals per ring) for <code>BlocksOnCylindrical</code>,
    scanners, which speeds up <code>ScatterEstimation</code> considerably. By default, downsampling the detectors per reading
    is disabled for backwards compatibility.<br>
    <a href=https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1291>PR #1291</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    Data from GE Discovery MI systems in RDF9 should now be readable. TOF information on these scanners has also been added.
    However, projection data is currently still always returned as non-TOF (but list-mode data is read as TOF).<br>
    <a href=https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1503>PR #1503</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <tt>stir_timings</tt> has now an extra option to parse a par-file for a projector-pair.
  </li>
  <li>
    Duration in sinogram interfile/exam_info obtained from <tt>lm_to_projdata</tt> has the correct value if we unlist all the events. This is not true for ROOT files<br>
    <a href=https://github.com/UCL/STIR/pull/1519>PR #1519</a>
  </li>
</ul>


<h3>Changed functionality</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Default ECAT scanner configurations updated to use a negative intrinsic tilt.
      </li>
    </ul>
