The scripts to run this example simulation use the Bourne shell (a subset of 
ksh, bash, zsh etc, but different from csh). 

If you want to modify these scripts, you probably will have to read a 
tutorial on shell scripting. Below are a few pointers to give you a basic 
understanding of what is in the current scripts.


Basically, a shell script is a step-by-step execution of commands, but with 
some if/for/etc statements thrown in. We use this here to call STIR
executables, but allow for some basic flexibility. Unfortunately, this 
flexibility makes the scripts more complicated. 

* what do $1, $2 etc mean?

These are variables that correspond to the arguments of the script (i.e. the 
first argument etc)

$0 is the name of the script (and `basename $0` is just 
   the filename of the script without path info)
$# is the number of arguments
$? is the return value of the last command executed. By convention, if 
   a program works fine, it should "return" 0.

* what does "if [ $? -ne 0 ];" mean?

It checks if the return value of the previous command is not equal to zero, i.e.
if it failed. If so, we'll write an error message and exit.

* and what about "${output}.log" etc?

somewhere above in the script "output" will have been set to a value. ${output}
now does a (string) substitution of that value. So, if you would do
   output=hello
   echo ${output}.log
would write 
   hello.log

Note: shell scripts do not normally treat the value of as a variable as a number
(unless you do something special, but here we didn't).

* This appears at then end of the "list_ROI_values line:  > /dev/null 2>&1"

This magic incantation says: pipe everything that goes to stderr to stdout and
then pipe stdout to /dev/null. /dev/null is the garbage can, so overall it means
"do not show any output".


* Before calling create_projdata_template in generate_input_data.sh, I see something like
cat > my_input.txt <<EOF
sometext
EOF

This is a shell-way to enter text into a text file (called my_input.txt). Whatever
appears between the 2 EOF strings will be written to my_input.txt. In the script
that file is then passed as input to create_projdata_template. This normally
expects you to type the answer to the questions, but here we provide the answer
already.
