/*! \ingroup buildblock_detail
   \brief a templated class used to check if it's a 1D array or not
   This class only exists to allow a work-around for older compilers
   (such as VC 6.0) that do not implement partial ordering of
   function templates or partial template specialisation.

   For modern compilers one can write
   \code
   // generic case
   template <int n, class T> void f(Array<n,T>&);
   // 1D case
   template <class T>        void f(Array<1,T>&);
   \endcode
   The work-around is as follows
   \code
   // generic case
   template <int n, class T> void f_help(is_not_1d, Array<n,T>&);
   // 1D case
   template <class T>        void f_help(is_1d, Array<1,T>&);
   // function that will dispatch
   template <int n, class T> void f(Array<n,T>& a)
   { f_help(test_if_1d<n>(), a); }
   \endcode
   So, the same effect is achieved by having one extra function.
   Of course, the name <tt>f_help</tt> is arbitrary, and could just as well
   be <tt>f</tt>. However, it's best to hide these away from the user, as they
   should never be used explicitly.
