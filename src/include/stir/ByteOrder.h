  \class ByteOrder
  \ingroup buildblock
  \brief This class provides member functions to
  find out what byte-order your machine is and to swap numbers.

  \par Some machine architectures:
  -Little endian processors: Intel, Alpha, VAX, PDP-11, ...
  -Big endian processors: Sparc, PowerPC, Motorola 68???, ...

  In a little-endian architecture, within a given 16- or 32-bit word,
   bytes at lower addresses have lower significance
   (the word is stored `little-end-first').
   (Quoted from http://www.techfak.uni-bielefeld.de/~joern/jargon/)

/*
  \brief Internal class to swap bytes.

  This defines a revert function that swaps the outer elements of an
  array, and then calls itself recursively.
  Due to the use of templates, the recursion gets resolved at compile
  time.
  (We have to use a class for this, as we rely on
  template specialisation, which is unavailable for functions).

  \warning This class should not be used anywhere, except in the
  ByteOrder::swap_order implementation.

/*
  It really shouldn't be in this include file, but we have to because
  of a compiler bug in VC++ (member templates have to be defined in the
  class).
