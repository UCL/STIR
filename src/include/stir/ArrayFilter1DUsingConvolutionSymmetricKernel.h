  \brief This class implements convolution of a 1D array with a symmetric kernel.

  Convolution is non-periodic:

  \f[ out_i = \sum_j kernel_j in_{i+j} \f]

  Elements of the input array that are outside its
  index range are considered to be 0.

  \warning 2 argument operator() currently requires that out_array and in_array
  have the same index range

    uses a kernel whose coefficients are given by
