  Sadly std::accumulate uses operator+(). For non-trivial objects,
  this might call an inefficient version for the addition.
  Alternatively, std::accumulate could be called with a function object
  that calls operator+=. Still, in that case you need to specify an
  initial value.

  If the range is empty, this function calls operator*=(0) to initialise the object to 0.
