  \brief The base class for all 3 dimensional shapes

  Shape3D objects are intended to represent geometrical object with
  sharp boundaries. So, a point is inside or shape, or it is not (i.e.
  no fuzzyness).

  The only derived class where this is relaxed is DiscretisedShape3D.
  However, this then needs some special treatment for some member
  functions, and you have to be somewhat careful with that class.

  \todo This could/should be generalised to allow general fuzzy shapes.
  Probably the only thing to change is to let is_inside_shape() return
  a float (between 0 and 1). This would solve some issues with
  DiscretisedDhape3D.

  \todo The restriction to the 3D case for this base class largely comes
  from the construct_volume() member (and the origin parsing members)

  \todo This base class really should have no origin member.
  For example, DiscretisedShape3D now has effectively two.
  Instead, we should have an additional class Shape3DWithOrigin.
  Easy to do.

  \par Parsing
  This base class defines the following keywords for parsing
  \verbatim
  ; specify origin as {z,y,x}
  origin (in mm):= <float> ;defaults to {0,0,0}
  \endverbatim

      \par Implementation note

      This virtual function has to be implemented in each final class of the hierarchy.
      However, Shape3D::operator== has an implementation that checks equality of the
      origin (up-to a tolerance of .001). Derived classes can call this implementation.

    \brief Determine (approximately) the intersection volume of a voxel with the shape.

    \param voxel_centre is a cartesian coordinate in 'absolute' coordinates,
    i.e. in mm and <b>not</b> relative to the \a origin member.
    \param voxel_size is the voxel size in mm.
    \param num_samples determines the number of samples to take in z,y,x
    direction.
    \return a value between 0 and 1 representing the fraction of the
    voxel inside the shape

    In the Shape3D implementation, this is simply done by calling
    is_inside_shape() at various points in the voxel, and returning
    the average value. Obviously, this will only approximate the
    intersection volume for very large \a num_samples, or when the
    voxel is completely inside the shape.

    \brief construct an image representation the shape in a discretised manner

    In principle, each voxel is sub-sampled to allow smoother edges.
    \warning Shapes have to be larger than the voxel size for sensible results.
    For efficiency reasons, the current implementation of this function
    does a first pass through the image where is_inside_shape() is called
    only for the centre of the voxels. After this, only edge voxels are
    resampled. So, if a shape lies between the centre of all voxels,
    it will not be sampled at all.
  \todo Get rid of restriction to allow only VoxelsOnCartesianGrid<float>
  (but that's rather hard)
  \todo Potentially this should fill a DiscretisedShape3D.
