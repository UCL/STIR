//! division of two ranges, 0/0 = 0

  \ingroup numerics

  This function sets 0/0 to 0 (not the usual NaN). It is for instance useful in
  Poisson log-likelihood computation.

  Because of potential numerical rounding problems, we test if a number is
  0 by comparing its absolute value with a small value, which is determined
  by multiplying the maximum in the \c numerator range with \a small_num.

  \warning This function does not test for non-zero numbers by 0. Results in
  that case will likely depend on your processor and/or compiler settings.
