 \brief Generic function to get the values of a 3D function on a regular grid
 \ingroup numerics
 \param[in,out] out array that will be filled with the function values. Its dimensions are used to find
   the coordinates where to sample the function (see below).
 \param[in] func function to sample
 \param[in] offset offset to use for coordinates (see below)
 \param[in] step step size to use for coordinates (see below)

 Symbolically, this function does the following computation for every index in the array
 \code
  out(index) = func(index * step - offset)
 \endcode

 \par requirement for type  FunctionType
 Due to the calling sequence above, the following has to be defined
 \code
   elemT FunctionType::operator(const BasicCoordinate<3, positionT>&)
 \endcode

 \todo  At the moment, only the 3D version is implemented, but this could be templated.
