  \brief Definition of work-around macros STIR_isnan and STIR_finite for a few non-portable IEEE floating point functions

  \warning The setting of these macros is tricky and only tested on a few systems.
  Hopefully, somebody else can find a better way. For example,
  http://std.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2004/n1568.htm

\def STIR_isnan(x)
A (hopefully) portable way to call isnan. Current implementation does not always
find isnan and then reverts to (x)!=(x), which according to IEEE math should work as well.
