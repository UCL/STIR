  \brief A class for measuring elapsed CPU time.

  CPUTimer is derived from Timer, and hence has the same interface. It
  returns the amount of CPU time (in secs) used by the current process and its
  children.
  \warning If too long CPU times are measured, wrap-around will occur.
  \warning Currently, CPUTimer returns garbage on Win95 (and probably Win98). It does
  work fine on NT, XP etc though.

  \par Implementation details

  For most systems, CPUTimer::value() returns elapsed CPU time using the
  ANSI clock() function.  From the man page:
  \verbatim
  The reported time is the sum
  of the CPU time of the calling process and its terminated child
  processes for which it has executed wait, system, or pclose
  subroutines.
  \endverbatim
  clock() has a possible problem of wrap-around. For many Unix systems this
  occurs very soon. For a SUN, the man page states this is every 2147 secs
  of CPU time (36 minutes !). AIX should be similar, as both have
  CLOCKS_PER_SEC = 10e6, and clock_t == int == 32 bit.

  So, since version 1.2 the times() function (with the rms_utime field)
  is used if <code>defined(__OS_UNIX__)</code>. The  man page for times() states something
  very similar to clock():

  <i>
  tms_utime : The CPU time used for executing instructions in the user
   space of the calling process.

   This information is read from the calling process as well as from
   each completed child process for which the calling process executed
   a wait subroutine.
  </i>

  As times() returns results measured in clock interrupt clicks (on AIX
  100 per second), wrap around occurs much later.


  Finally, VC++ 5.0 seems to have a bug in clock() that makes its results
  dependent on the load of the system (i.e. it is more like 'wall clock
  time').
  We now use GetProcessTimes() (with the lpUserTime variable) instead.
  The documentation states:

  <i>
  ... the amount of time that the process has executed in user mode.
  The time that each of the threads of the process has executed in user
  mode is determined, and then all of those times are summed together to
  obtain this value.
  </i>

  Warning: this only works for NT, not for Win95
