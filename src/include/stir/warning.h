//! Print warning with format string a la \c printf
/*! \ingroup buildblock

  The arguments are the same as if you would call printf(). The warning message is written to stderr,
  preceeded by "WARNING:".

  \par Example
  \code
  warning("Cannot open file %s, but I will work around it", filename);
  \endcode

  \deprecated (use 1 argument version instead)
*/
void warning(const char* const s, ...);

//! Use this function for writing warning messages
/*! \ingroup buildblock

  The argument is expected to be a string, but could be anything for which
  std::ostream::operator\<\< would work.

  This function currently first writes a newline, then \c WARNING:, then \c string
  and then another newline to std::cerr.

  \todo At a later stage, it will also write to a log-file.

  \c boost::format is useful in this context.

  \par Example
  \code
  warning(boost::format("Type is like this: %1%. Not sure if that will work.") % projdata_info.parameter_info());

  warning("This might not work");
  \endcode
