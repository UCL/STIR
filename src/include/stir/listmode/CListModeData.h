  \brief The base class for reading list mode data.
  \ingroup listmode

  \todo Currently, this class (and CListRecord) is specific to PET, i.e. to
  coincidence detection (hence the 'C'). However, the only part that
  is not general are the functions related to prompts and delayeds.
  Potentially, we make classes ListModeData etc which would work for SPECT
  (and other count-based modalities?). Alternatively, SPECT can be
  handled by calling all single photon events 'prompts'.

  \par Notes for developers
