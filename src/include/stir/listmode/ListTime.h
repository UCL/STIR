/*! \ingroup listmode
    ListTime is used to provide an interface to the 'timing' events
    in the list mode stream. Usually, the timing event also contains
    gating information. For rotating scanners, it could also contain
    angle info.

    \todo this is still under development. Things to add are angles
    or so for rotating scanners. Also, some info on the maximum
    (and actual?) number of gates would be useful.
    \see ListModeData for more info on list mode data.
