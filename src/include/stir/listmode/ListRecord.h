    This represents either a timing or coincidence event in a list mode
    data stream.

    Some scanners can have more types of records. For example,
    the Quad-HiDAC puts singles information in the
    list mode file. If you need that information,
    you will have to do casting to e.g. ListRecordQHiDAC.

    \see ListModeData for more info on list mode data.
