//! Class for storing and using gamma events from a SPECT List mode file
/*! \ingroup listmode
    SPECTListEvent is used to provide an interface to the actual events (i.e.
    detected counts) in the list mode stream.

    \todo this is still under development. Things to add are for instance
    energy windows and time-of-flight info. Also, get_bin() would need
    time info or so for rotating scanners.

    \see SPECTListModeData for more info on list mode data.
