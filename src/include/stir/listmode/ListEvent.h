//! Class for storing and using gamma events from a list mode file
/*! \ingroup listmode
    ListEvent is used to provide an interface to the actual events (i.e.
    detected counts) in the list mode stream.

    \todo this is still under development. Things to add are for instance
    energy windows and time-of-flight info. Also, get_bin() would need
    time info or so for rotating scanners.

    \see ListModeData for more info on list mode data.

  //! Finds the LOR between the coordinates where the detection took place
  /*! Obviously, these coordinates are only estimates which depend on the
      scanner hardware. For example, Depth-of-Interaction might not be
      taken into account. However, the intention is that this function returns
      'likely' positions (e.g. not the face of a crystal, but a point somewhere
      in the middle).

      Coordinates are in mm and in the standard STIR coordinate system
      used by ProjDataInfo etc (i.e. origin is in the centre of the scanner).

      \todo This function might need time info or so for rotating scanners.

      an LOR outside the range of the projection data.

      bin.get_bin_value() will be set to a negative value if no such bin
      can be found.

      Currently, bin.get_bin_value() might indicate some weight
      which can be used for normalisation. This is unlikely
      to remain the case in future versions.

      The default implementation uses get_LOR()
      and ProjDataInfo::get_bin(). However, a derived class
      can overload this with a more efficient implementation.

    \todo get_bin() might need time info or so for rotating scanners.
