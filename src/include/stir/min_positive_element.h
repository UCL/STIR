   \param start start of the sequence. Usually object.begin().
   \param end end of the sequence in iterator sense (so actually one beyond
     the last element). Usually object.end().
   \return an iterator that points to the element in the sequence which
     has the smallest (strictly) positive value. If no (strictly) positive
     element is found, or if the sequence is empty, the \a end argument
     is returned.

   The iterator type has to satisfy the requirements of a forward iterator,
   and its value_type has to be comparable using &lt; and &lt;=.
