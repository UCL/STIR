\defgroup evaluation Classes for computing ROI values and other FOMs
   For image evaluation, it is often necessary to compute ROI values,
   or other simple Figures of Merits (FOMs). These classes
   and functions allow you do to this directly in STIR. This is mainly
   useful for automation, as there is no nice graphical interface in STIR
   to draw ROIs etc.

/*!
\defgroup projection Projection building blocks
\ingroup recon_buildblock
Everything (?) related to projection matrices, forward and back projection.

In the context of image reconstruction, 'forward projection' means going from
the image to an estimate of the (mean of the) data. This is because in
SPECT and PET, the measurements can be seen to be approximations of line
integrals through the object.

STIR keeps this terminology, even though it is unfortunate. (For instance,
a stir::ProjMatrix is not a projection matrix in the mathematical sense.)
*/
/*!
\defgroup symmetries Symmetries building blocks
\ingroup projection
Usually, there are (geometric) symmetries between the image and the projection
data. This means that various elements of the projection matrix will be equal.
The classes in this module convert this concept into code, such that projection
matrices need only be computed for the 'independent' bins.
*/
/*!
\defgroup normalisation Normalisation building blocks
\ingroup recon_buildblock
Everything related to BinNormalisation classes.

In PET 'normalisation' is used to describe a multiplicative calibration of
every detector-pair. More generally, it can be used to the process of
'correcting' projection data by multiplying every bin with a factor.
