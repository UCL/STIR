  \def  STIRIsNativeByteOrderBigEndian
  \ingroup buildblock
  \brief A macro that is defined to 1 when the compilation is on
  a big endian machine, otherwise it is set to 0.

  \par Usage
  \code
  #if STIRIsNativeByteOrderBigEndian
  // code specific for big endian machines
  #else
  // code for little endian machines
  #endif
  \endcode

  \par Relation to the ByteOrder class.

  This should be used only in the case that you really need to know this
  at compilation time. Try to use class ByteOrder instead.

  The definition of class ByteOrder is independent of this macro.

  \warning It is recommended to check these settings by comparing with class
  ByteOrder. This is done by the ByteOrderTests class.

  \warning This macro depends on preprocessor defines set by your compiler.
  The list of defines is bound to be incomplete though. The current list sets
  LittleEndian for alpha, x86 or PowerPC processors or Windows using some
  macros which are known to work with gcc and Visual Studio (at some point also
  with CodeWarrior). Otherwise, the
  architecture is assumed to be big endian. ByteOrder does not rely on
  this type of conditionals.
  \warning   The value of the macro in the doxygen documentation depends on
  what type of machine doxygen was run.
