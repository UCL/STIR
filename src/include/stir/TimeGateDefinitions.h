  \brief Class used for storing time gate durations

  Times are supposed to be relative to the scan start time.

  Currently this class can read gate info from an ECAT6, ECAT7 and a 'gate definition'
  file. See the documentation for the constructor.

  Will probably be superseded by Study classes.

    The filename can point to a simple ASCII text file.
    The format is a number of lines, each existing of 2 numbers

    gate_num   duration_in_secs
    \endverbatim
    This duration is a double number.

    This class in fact allows an extension of the above. Setting
    \a gate_num_of_this_duration to 0 allows skipping
    a time period of the corresponding \a duration_in_secs.
