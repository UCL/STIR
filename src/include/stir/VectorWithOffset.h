/*!
  \ingroup Array
  \brief A templated class for vectors, but with indices starting not from 0

  Elements are guaranteed to be stored contiguously. (Emergency) methods
  are provided for accessing the data via a \c T*.

  This class tries to mimic std::vector for the most common methods, but
  it is much more conservative in its memory allocations.
  The only memory that is allocated is what you asked for (although the
  allocated memory hardly ever shrinks, except when calling recycle()).
  So, std::vector::push_back() etc are not provided, as they would be
  horribly inefficient for the current class (ok, except if you would have
  called reserve() first).

  It is possible to construct a VectorWithOffset that uses existing memory.
  It will then never deallocate that memory obviously. Note that when growing
  the vector (or assigning a bigger vector), the vector will allocate new
  memory. Any modifications to the vector then will no longer be connected
  to the original data block. This can always be tested using
  owns_memory_for_data().

  \warning This class does not satisfy full Container requirements.
  \warning Current implementation relies on shifting a \c T* outside the range
  of allocated data. This is not guaranteed to be valid by ANSI C++. It is fine
  however as long as the \c min_index is negative and such that \c abs(min_index) is
  smaller than \c max_index.
  \todo add allocator template as in std::vector. This is non-trivial as
  we would have to use uninitialized_copy etc. in some places.
