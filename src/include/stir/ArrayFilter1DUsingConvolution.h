  \ingroup Array
  \brief This class implements convolution of a 1D array with an
  arbitrary (i.e. potentially non-symmetric) kernel.

  Convolution is non-periodic:

  \f[ out_i = \sum_j kernel_j in_{i-j} \f]

  Note that for most kernels, the above convention means that the zero-
  index of the kernel corresponds to the peak in the kernel.

  By default, zero boundary conditions are used, i.e. elements of the input array
  that are outside its index range are considered to be 0.

  Currently, "constant" boundary conditions are also implemented, i.e. elements of the input array
  that are outside its index range are considered to the same as the nearest element in the array
  (i.e. first element on the "left" and last element on the "right").

  \par Example 1
  A straightforward low-pass filter, with a symmetric kernel
  \code
  VectorWithOffset<float> kernel(-1,1);
  kernel[-1] = kernel[1] = .25F; kernel[0] = 0.5F;
  ArrayFilter1DUsingConvolution<float> lowpass_filter(kernel);
  \endcode
  \par Example 2
  A filter which shifts the output 1 index to the right, i.e. \f$ out_i = in_{i-1}\f$
  \code
  VectorWithOffset<float> kernel(1,1);
  kernel[1] = 1.F;
  ArrayFilter1DUsingConvolution<float> right_shift_filter(kernel);
  \endcode

  \warning 1 argument operator() currently leaves the array with the
  the same index range, i.e. it does not extend it with the kernel size or so.

  \see ArrayFilter1DUsingSymmetricConvolution for an implementation
  when the kernel is symmetric. (Note: it's not clear if that implementation
  results in faster execution).

  \todo implement other boundary conditions
