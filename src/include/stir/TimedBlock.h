/*! \brief Helper class for measuring execution time of a block of code.
\ingroup buildblock

It starts the timer in ctor, stops in dtor.
Do not create unnamed instances of this class, as they are quite
useless: you cannot predict destruction time.

\par Usage:

\code

SomeTimer t;
// do whatever you want here
{
TimedBlock<SomeTimer> tb(t);
do_something_1();
do_something_2();
};
// do whatever you want here
{
TimedBlock<SomeTimer> tb(t);
do_something_3();
};
// do whatever you want here
cout << "It took " << t.GetTime() << "sec to execute do_something_1..3()" << endl;

\endcode

\par Template argument requirements

\c TimerT has to have a start() and stop() member function. This is the case for
stir::Timer (and derived functions) and stir::HighResWallClockTimer.

  //! Create a timed block
  inline TimedBlock(TimerT& Timer);
