  \brief Compute a mask for the "tails" in the sinogram

  This computes the outer part of the projection data that
  does not receive any (unscattered) contributions from inside the body.
  Its normal input is a projection data with attenuation-correction factors
  (ACFs). We take a threshold as parameter (which should be a bit larger
  than 1). Along each line in the sinogram, we search from the edges
  until we find the first bin above the threshold. We then go back a
  few bins (as set by \a safety-margin). All bins from the edge until
  this point are included in the mask.

  As from 23 July 2016, the functionality of this executable was transfered in
  a new class CreateTailMaskFromACFs. This made possible to use par file to
  initiliase the process and use it from within some other code.

  In the latter case, where the output will be used from some other code the
  output file can be omitted, in order to avoid unnecessary outputs.
