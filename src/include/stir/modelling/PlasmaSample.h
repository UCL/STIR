 \ingroup modelling

 A class for storing radiotracer concentration in a blood sample. Concentrations in plasma and the (overall) blood-concentration
 are stored.

 \todo This currently assumes sampling, while in practice we often have data accumulated over time, but this can
 currently not be encoded.
