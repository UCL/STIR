\ingroup projdata
\brief Extension of direct projection data in view direction.

Functions that extend the given sinogram or segment in the view direction taking
periodicity into account, if exists. If the sinogram is not symmetric in
tangential position, the values are extrapolated by nearest neighbour known values.

This is probably only useful before calling interpolation routines, or for FORE.
