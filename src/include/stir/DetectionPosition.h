 \brief
 A class for storing coordinates of a detection.

 This encodes where
 a gamma photon was detected on a detector array. For example, in a
 cylindrical PET scanner, this class stores the crystal where a gamma
 was detected.

 The scanner might have more
 than 1 detector array (for example a dual-headed system), but this info is
 (currently) not in this class. Also, the detector array might be rotating
 during acquisition. The corresponding angle is also not in the class.

 This is essentially a collection of 3 numbers:
 <ol>
 <li>\c tangential_coord: a coordinate running tangentially to the
 scanner cylinder, and orthogonal to the scanner axis. For a
 cylindrical PET scanner, this would be the Detection number in a ring.
 <li>\c axial_coord: a coordinate running along the scanner axis.
 For a cylindrical PET scanner, it would correspond to the ring number.
 <li>\c radial_coord: a coordinate 'orthogonal' to the 2 previous ones. This
 is only used for scanners with multiple layers of detectors (which would
 give Depth Of Interaction information). radial_coord==0 corresponds to
 the layer closest to the centre of the scanner.
 </ol>
 All 3 coordinates are normally positive, and start with 0.
 \todo document directions

 For scanners that do not need 3 coordinates, there is a space overhead
 but no performance overhead, except in the comparison functions.
 The class is templated to allow for systems with continuous detection.
