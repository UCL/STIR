   \brief find width at a level

   \param[in] max_iterator location from where the search will start, should be close
      to the location of the (local) maximum you want to investigate
   \param[in] end_iterator end of sequence to check
   \param[in] level_height intensity level at which to find the width
   \return width of the level set (in pixel units)

   The implementation assumes uniform spacing between the samples.

   We use linear interpolation between samples to estimate where the function value
   reaches the \a level_height value.

   If the search runs to the end/start of the sequence, a warning is issued, and the width
   is estimated using linear extrapolation.

   \ingroup resolution
   \brief Finds FWHM, FWTM etc (in mm) for a number of point sources or a line source

   \param[in] input_image
   \param[in] num_maxima  the number of maxima to find (see below)
   \param[in] level level at which to compute the width (2 for half maximum, 10 for tenth maximum etc.)
   \param[in] dimension the dimension along which the line source is oriented, or 0 for point sources
   \param[in] nema enables the calculation based on the NEMA Standards Publication
   NU 2-2001.
   \return a list containing the maximum_value, its location per slice and resolution.
   For line sources, sorted by minimum to maximum slice of the requested dimension, or for point sources,
   sorted by maximum to minimum value.

   For line sources, \a num_maxima slices are sampled (from first to last slice, with steps given by num_slices/(num_maxima+1)

   For point sources, if \a num_maxima is larger than 1, after finding a maximum and the resolution, the data is masked out in
   a neigbhourhood of half-size (resolution*2/level). This will only ork properly if the point sources are not too close to
   eachother and have roughly the maximum.

   The value of the maximum is computed using a parabolic fit through the 3 points around the maximum as specified
   in NEMA 2001.

   If nema=false, the interpolate_line() function is used to find a line, otherwise we use  extract_line().
