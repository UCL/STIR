  The result is in mm in STIR physical coordinates, i.e. taking the origin into account.

  The result can be used to find the central line of a (uniform) object, for
  instance a cylinder. The output of this function can by used by
  linear_regression().

  The weight is currently simply the sum of the voxel values in that plane,
  thresholded to be at least 0. If the weight is 0, the x,y coordinates are
  simply set to 0.
