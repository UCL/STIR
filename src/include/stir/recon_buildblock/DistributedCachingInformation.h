/*!
  \ingroup distributable
  \brief This class implements the logic needed to support caching in a distributed manner.

  To enable distributed caching, the master needs to store how the view segment numbers or the
  related viewgrams respectively were distributed between the workers. Doing that, the master
  is able to send those viegrams to a slave requesting for work, which that specific slave already
  handled before and still has cached locally.
  Additionally it is possible to only send the view segment number instead of the whole projection
  data, if the the worker stores the recieved related viewgrams.

  This class stores all needed information to determine a not yet processed view segment number
  that will be sent to the requesting slave in such a way that the belonging data most likely
  is stored in the slaves cache.

  The function \c get_unprocessed_vs_num() can be called by the master, passing the requesting worker
  and the current subset to determine the next processed view segment number

  The logic is a bit sophisticated, as it has to make sure, that every vs_num is
  only processed once and that load balancing is forced. T

  Process numbers are expected to be between 0 and \c num_workers

  Whether to use the cache enabled function or not can be set by the parsing parameter
\verbatim
  enable distributed caching := 0
\endverbatim
  within the parameter specification for the objective function, where 1 activates it and 0 deactivates
  caching. The default is set to 0.
