  \ingroup GeneralisedObjectiveFunction
  \brief An objective function class appropriate for PET list mode data

  The statistics for list mode data is slightly different from having a set
  of counts, see the paper
  H. H. Barrett, L. Parra, and T. White,
  <i>List-mode likelihood,</i> J. Optical Soc. Amer. A, vol. 14, no. 11, 1997.

  However, it is intuitive that the list mode likelihood can be
  derived from that 'binned' likelihood by taking smaller and smaller
  time bins. One can then see that the gradient of the list mode
  likelihood can be computed similar to the 'binned' case, but now
  with a sum over events. The sensitivity still needs a sum (or integral)
  over all possible detections.

  At present, STIR does not contain any classes to forward/back
  project list mode data explictly. So, the sum over events cannot
  be computed for arbitrary list mode data. This is currently
  done in derived classes.

  For list mode reconstructions, computing the sensitivity is sometimes
  conceptually very difficult (how to compute the integral) or impractical.
  So, even if we will be able to compute the sum over events in a generic way,
  the add_subset_sensitivity() function will have to be implemented by
  a derived class, specific for the measurement.

    probably shift this to the derived class.

    the same as what was used when creating the cache. This is therefore quite risky.
