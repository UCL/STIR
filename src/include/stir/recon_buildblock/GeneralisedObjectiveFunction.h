  \ingroup GeneralisedObjectiveFunction
  \brief
  A base class for 'generalised' objective functions, i.e. objective
  functions for which at least a 'gradient' is defined. 

  Some iterative algorithms use an 'objective function' only in a 
  loose sense. They might for instance allow generalisations 
  which no longer optimise a function. For example in the case
  of PoissonLogLikelihoodWithLinearModelForMeanAndProjData
  with non-matching forward and back projectors, the 'gradient' 
  that is computed is generally not the gradient of the
  log-likelihood that corresponds to the forward projector.
  However, one hopes that it still points towards the optimum.

  Often, one includes a penalty (or prior) in the objective function. This
  class uses a GeneralisedPrior object for this. Note that we use the convention that
  the objective function is maximised. The penalty is expected to
  be a function that increases with higher penalty, so it will be <i>subtracted</i>
  from the unregularised case.

  In tomography, we often use subsets, where the objective function
  is written as a sum of sub-objective functions. This class has some
  subset functionality. When using subsets, the 
  penalty will be distributed evenly over all subsets. While this increases
  the computational cost, it makes the subsets more 'balanced' which
  is best for most algorithms.

  \see IterativeReconstruction


  \todo Currently, there is subset code in both IterativeReconstruction and here.
  This is confusing and leads to repetition. It probably should all be moved here.
