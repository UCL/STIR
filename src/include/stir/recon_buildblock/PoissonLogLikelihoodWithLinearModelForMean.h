  \ingroup GeneralisedObjectiveFunction
  \brief a base class for  LogLikelihood of independent Poisson variables
  where the mean values are linear combinations of the parameters.

  Suppose the measured data \f$y\f$ are statistically independent and
  Poisson distributed with mean \f$\bar y\f$. The log likelihood is then
  given by

  \f[ L(y\;\bar y) = \sum_b y_b log \bar y_b - \mathrm{log} y_b! - \bar y_b \f]

  If the means are modeled by some functions of some parameters
  \f$Y(\lambda)\f$, the gradient w.r.t. those parameters follows
  immediately as

  \f[ {\partial L \over \partial \lambda_v} =
      \sum_b \left( {y_b \over Y_b} - 1 \right)
             {\partial Y_b \over \partial \lambda_v }
  \f]

  In this class, it is assumed that the means are linear functions of
  the parameters, which using matrices and vectors can be written
  (in a notation familiar to PET people) as

  \f[ Y = P \lambda + r \f]

  If the background term \f$r\f$ is 0, \f$P_{bv}\f$  gives
  the conditional probability of detecting a count in bin \f$b\f$
  if the parameter \f$\lambda_v\f$ is 1 and all others 0.

  In this case, the gradient is given by
  \f[ {\partial L \over \partial \lambda_v} =
      \sum_b P_{bv} {y_b \over Y_b} - P_v
  \f]
  where
  \f[
  P_v = \sum_b P_{bv}
  \f]
  where the sum is over all possible bins (not only those where
  any counts were detected). We call the vector given by \f$P_v\f$
  the <i>sensitivity</i> because (if \f$r=0\f$) it is the total
  probability of detecting a count (in any bin) originating from \f$v\f$.

  This class computes the gradient as a sum of these two terms. The
  sensitivity has to be computed by the virtual function
  \c add_subset_sensitivity(). The sum is computed by
  \c compute_sub_gradient_without_penalty_plus_sensitivity().

  The reason for this is that the sensitivity is data-independent, and
  can be computed only once. See also
  PoissonLogLikelihoodWithLinearModelForMeanAndListModeData.

  \par Relation with Kullback-Leibler distance

  Note that up to terms independent of \f$\bar y\f$, the log likelihood
  is equal to minus the
  Kullback-Leibler generalised distance

  \f[ \mathrm{KL}(y,\bar y) = \sum_b y_b \mathrm{log}(y_b/\bar y_b) + \bar y_b - y_b \f]

  which has the nice property that \f$\mathrm{KL}(y,\bar y)=0\f$ implies that
  \f$y=\bar y\f$.

  \par Parameters for parsing
  Defaults are indicated below
  \verbatim
  ; specifies if we keep separate sensitivity images (which is more accurate and is
  ; recommended) or if we assume the subsets are exactly balanced
  ; and hence compute the subset-senstivity as sensitivity/num_subsets (this uses less memory).
  use_subset_sensitivities := 1
  ; for recomputing sensitivity, even if a filename is specified
  recompute sensitivity:= 0
  ; filename for reading the sensitivity, or writing if it is recomputed
  ; if use_subset_sensitivities=0
  sensitivity filename:=
  ; pattern for filename for reading the subset sensitivities, or writing if recomputed
  ; if use_subset_sensitivities=1
  ; e.g. subsens_%d.hv
  ; boost::format is used with the pattern (which means you can use it like sprintf)
  subset sensitivity filenames:=
  \endverbatim

  \par Terminology
  We currently use \c sub_gradient for the gradient of the likelihood of the subset (not
  the mathematical subgradient).
