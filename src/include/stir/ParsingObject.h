  \brief A base class for objects that want to be able to parse parameter files.

  This class is essentially a wrapper for KeyParser, such that it is safe to
  copy ParsingObject objects. The problem with KeyParser is that it stores
  pointers to the variables it needs to fill in. So, if you copy one KeyParser
  object to another, both will fill in the same variables (unless add_key is
  called afterwards). ParsingObject solves this by having a copy constructor
  that reinitialises all keys in its own (protected) KeyParser object.

  \warning All this only works when all keys are set in the initialise_keymap()
  function, and \b only there.
  \see KeyParser

  /*!
    This virtual function should be overloaded when the values for the keywords
    depend on other variables in the derived class that can be set independently
    of the parsing.

  \par Example:

  A derived class has a public member angle_in_radians, while a keyword sets a
  private member angle_in_degrees.
