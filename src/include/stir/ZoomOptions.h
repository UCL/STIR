  \brief
  This class enables the user to choose between different zooming options
  \ingroup buildblock

  The 3 possible values determine a global scale factor used for the end result:
  (i) preserve sum (locally)
  (ii) preserve values (like interpolation)
  (iii) preserve projections: using a STIR forward projector on the zoomed image will give (approximately) the same projections.
