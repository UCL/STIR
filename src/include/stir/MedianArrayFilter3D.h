  \ingroup Array
  \brief Implements median filtering on 3D arrays.

  The median for a 1D array of 2n+1 elements is defined as the nth element
  of the sorted array. For 2n elements, we use (sorted[n-1]+sorted[n])/2
  (starting indices from 0).

  For 3D images, the current filter works by extracting all neigbours (given by
  the mask) to a 1D array, and getting the median of that array.

  This implementation of the median filter handles edges by taking a median of
  all available pixels. For instance, when a 3x3 mask is used, and the
  pixel-to-be-filtered is at the left edge, there will be only 6 pixels in the
  mask (instead of 9).

  \todo Currently, the mask is determined in terms of the mask radius (in pixels), where
  size = 2*radius+1. This could easily be relaxed.
  \todo generalise to n-dimensions
