  \brief Implementation of functions related to setting/getting the number of threads

//! Get current maximum number of threads
/*! \ingroup threads
  This returns the maxmimum number of threads to be used by STIR.
  Usually this should be equal to what you set earlier via set_num_threads().

  Currently only useful when compiled with OpenMP support. Corresponds then
  to omp_get_max_threads()
*/
int get_max_num_threads();

//! Set current number of threads
/*! \ingroup threads
  This can be used to increase/decrease the number of threads used by STIR
  from the default value (see get_default_num_threads()).

  If \a num_threads is zero (and therefore when no arguments are passed) and
  if this is the first time this function is called, it will call
  set_default_num_threads().

  Therefore, after calling <code>set_num_threads(5)</code>, future calls to
  <code>set_num_threads()</code> will keep using 5 threads. This is used
  internally in STIR (e.g. in distributable_computation) to normally
  use the default number of threads, but let the user change it.

void set_num_threads(const int num_threads = 0);

//! Get default number of threads
/*! \ingroup threads
 If OpenMP support is enabled, the default is normally set from the
 \c OMP_NUM_THREADS environment variable. However, if this is is
 not set, we use ~90% of the available processors.

  Currently only useful when compiled with OpenMP support.
