  \brief This class can be used to store 'factories' and their corresponding
   keys. It is essentially a map, but with some extra embelishments.

  A factory is supposed to be an object which can create another object,
  although this is not really enfored by the implementation of
  FactoryRegistry.

  \par Type requirements

  Key,Factory,Compare must be suitable as defined for std::map. In addition,
  FactoryRegistry::list_keys() requires that operator<<(ostream&, const Key&)
  is defined.

  \todo Probably it would be better to store pointers to factories. However,
  in that case, the destructor of FactoryRegistry would have to deallocate
  these factory objects. This would mean that factories have to be allocated
  with new, and hence would prevent using simple function pointers.

  /*! If the key is not found, the behaviour depends on which constructor
      was used. If the (default) no-argument constructor is used, an
      error message is printed, and the program aborts.
      If the 2nd constructor with default values, the default_factory is
      returned.
