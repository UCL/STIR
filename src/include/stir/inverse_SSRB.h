  \param[out] proj_data_4D Its projection_data_info is used to
  determine output characteristics (e.g. number of segments). Data will be 'put' in here using
  ProjData::set_sinogram().
  \param[in] proj_data_3D input data

  The STIR implementation of Inverse SSRB applies the
  inverse idea of SSRB. inverse_SSRB will produce oblique
  sinograms by finding the sinogram that has the same
  'm'-coordinate (i.e. the intersection with the z-axis
  of the central LOR). In addition, if the output sinogram would lie 'half-way'
  2 input sinograms, it will be set to the average of the 2 input sinograms.

  Note that any oblique segments in \a proj_data_3D are currently ignored.

  Input and output projectino data should have the same number of views and tangential positions.
