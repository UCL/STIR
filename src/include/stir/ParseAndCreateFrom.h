//! template for adding keywords to a parser and creating an object
/*!
  \ingroup buildblock

  The idea is that a reconstructor needs to be able to create an image based
  on some parameters and the current input data. However, this needs to be flexible
  for different types, as for instance, many different reconstructors produce
  a DiscretisedDensity object but from different input data, or vice versa.

  We do this using specialisations of this class. That way,
  PoissonLogLikelihoodWithLinearModelForMeanAndProjData etc can be templated
  without having to know what the actual \c OutputT is.

  This of course only works if a specialisation is created for the
  \c OutputT and \InputT of interest.

  A specialisation needs to define all four member functions as the reconstruction
  code will otherwise break.

  The default implementations don't do anything (aside from create()).

  Check ParseAndCreateFrom<DiscretisedDensity<3, elemT>, ExamDataT> for an example
  which might make sense.

class ParseAndCreateFrom {
public:
  //! set default values for any parameters
  void set_defaults() {}
  //! add any relevant parameters to a parser
  void add_to_keymap(ParserT&) {}
  //! should call error() if something is wrong
  void check_values() const {};

  //! create a new object
  /*!
    This can take any parsed parameters into account.

    The default just calls \c new.

    \todo Currently we're assuming this returns a bare pointer (to a new object).
    This is due to limitations in the reconstruction classes. It will need to change
    to a \c std::unique pointer.

  OutputT* create(const InputT&) const { return new OutputT(); }

//! parse keywords for creating a VoxelsOnCartesianGrid from ProjData etc
/*!
  \ingroup densitydata

  This specialisation adds keywords like size etc to the parser, and calls
  the VoxelsOnCartesianGrid constructor with ExamInfo and ProjDataInfo arguments
  to obtain an image that is suitable to store the reconstruction.

  Assumes that \c ExamDataT has \c get_exam_info_sptr() and \c get_proj_data_info_sptr()
  members.

  \todo Currently only supports VoxelsOnCartesianGrid parameters (we could introduce
  another keyword to differentiate between types).
