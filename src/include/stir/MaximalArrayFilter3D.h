/*!
  \ingroup Array
  \brief Implements erosion on 3D arrays.

  The minimum value for a 1D array of 2n+1 elements is defined as the minimum element
  of the sorted array.

  For 3D images, the current filter works by extracting all neigbours (given by
  the mask) to a 1D array, and getting the maximal of that array.

  This implementation of the maximal filter handles edges by taking the minimum of
  all available pixels. For instance, when a 3x3 mask is used, and the
  pixel-to-be-filtered is at the left edge, there will be only 6 pixels in the
  mask (instead of 9).

  \todo Currently, the mask is determined in terms of the mask radius (in pixels), where
  size = 2*radius+1. This could easily be relaxed.
  \todo generalise to n-dimensions
