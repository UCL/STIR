  \ingroup Array
  \brief This class implements convolution of an array of real numbers with an
  arbitrary (i.e. potentially non-symmetric) kernel using DFTs.

  Convolution is periodic.

  Elements of the input array that are outside its
  index range are considered to be 0.

  If the input and output arrays are smaller than half the length of the kernel,
  then there is enough zero-padding such that aliasing cannot occur.
  In this case, this class gives the same results as
  ArrayFilter1DUsingConvolution.

      normally, the 0- index corresponds to the middle of the PSF.

      Input data will be zero-padded to the same range as this kernel before
      DFT. If you want to avoid aliasing, make sure that the kernel is at least
      twice as long as the input and output arrays.
