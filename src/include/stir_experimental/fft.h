  \brief Declaration of FFT routines

  This are C++-ified version of Numerical Recipes routines. You need to have
  the book before you can use this!

  lengths of each dimension (number of complex values), which MUST all
  be powers of 2. data is a real array of length twice the product of
  thes lengths, in which the data are stored as in a multidimensional
  complex array: real and imaginary parts of each  element are in
  consecutive locations , and the rightmost index of the array
  increases most rapidly as one  proceeds along data. For a
  two-dimensional array, this  is equivalent  to storing  the
  array  by rows . If isign  is in input as -1 , data is replaced by
  its inverse transform time the product of the lengths of all dimensions.

  Replaces this data ( which is stored in array data[1..2n]) by the positive
  frequency half of its complex Fourier Transform. The real-valued first and
  last components of the complex transform are returned as element data[1] and
  data[2] respectively. n must be a power of 2. The routine also calculates
  the inverse transform of a complex data array if it is the transform of real
  data. (Result in this case must be multiplied by 1/n.)
