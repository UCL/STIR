/* A somewhat complicated way to determine the byteorder.
   The advantage is that it doesn't need ntohs (and so any
   compiler specific definitions, libraries or whatever).
   Philosophy: initialise a long number, look at its first byte
   by casting its address as a char *.
   The reinterpret_cash is to make it typesafe for C++.

   First we do a (paranoid) check :
      sizeof(unsigned long) - sizeof(unsigned char) > 0
   This is done via a 'compile-time assertion', i.e. it breaks
   at compile time when the assertion is false. The line below
   relies on the fact that you cannot have an array with
   zero (or less) elements.
