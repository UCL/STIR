This directory contains a number of subdirectories with code
written and Hammersmith Imanet Ltd and kindly contributed to STIR
by GE Healthcare.

It was mostly written by Kris Thielemand and his students and/or visitors.

This needs some clean-up however and is currently not documented.
It is not considered part of the STIR yet, in the sense that it is not
packaged. However, it is in the git repository as its history is tightly
bound to the rest of STIR.
