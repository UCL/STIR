  \brief create a "Multi" header for a set of data

  This is a command line utility for creating a header that "points" to several other
  data-sets, useful for e.g. dynamic images/data. The output header can then be used in
  other STIR utilities. This is useful for instance if you have
  a set of reconstruct images corresponding to several time frames, but need to read the data
  as a single study.

  The command line arguments are as follows:
  \code
  output_filename_with_extension in_data1 [in_data2 [in_data3...]]
  \endcode

  \warning There is no check that the data sizes and other info are compatible.
  Hence, lots of funny effects can happen if data are not compatible.
