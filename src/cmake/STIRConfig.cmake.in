# This file sets STIR_INCLUDE_DIRS, STIR_LIBRARIES and STIR_REGISTRIES.
# It also finds the packages that were used to build STIR as you need those
# to link against etc. It should normally not be required that you know about
# these, as they should be automatically added to the dependencies of the STIR
# libraries. Therefore, if you make a target that depends on ${STIR_LIBRARIES},
# its include_directories and linkage should automagically be ok.
#
# At this point in time, you do need to add
#  include_directories("${STIR_INCLUDE_DIRS}")
# to your CMake file to get the STIR_REGISTRIES to compile.
