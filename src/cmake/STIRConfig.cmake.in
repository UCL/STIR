# This file sets STIR_INCLUDE_DIRS, STIR_LIBRARIES and STIR_REGISTRIES.
# It also finds the packages that were used to build STIR as you need those
# to link against etc. It should normally not be required that you know about
# these, as they should be automatically added to the dependencies of the STIR
# libraries. Therefore, if you make a target that depends on ${STIR_LIBRARIES},
# its include_directories and linkage should automagically be ok.
#
# Usage is like this
#
#  find_package(STIR 5.1 CONFIG)
#  add_executable(my_exe ${STIR_REGISTRIES})
#  target_link_libraries(my_exe ${STIR_LIBRARIES})
#
# In addition, if your CMake (or the version used to compile STIR) is older than 3.12,
# you need to add
#
#  include_directories("${STIR_INCLUDE_DIRS}")
#
# to your CMake file to get the source files listed in STIR_REGISTRIES to compile.
# For more recent CMake, this should not be necessary (as STIR_REGISTRIES is then set to
# a list of compiled files).

# This file also sets variables such as STIR_BUILT_WITH_ITK, STIR_BUILT_WITH_OpenMP etc
# in case you need to how it was built.
