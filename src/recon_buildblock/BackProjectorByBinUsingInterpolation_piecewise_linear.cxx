  \brief This file defines two private static functions from
  stir::BackProjectorByBinUsingInterpolation, for the case of piecewise
  linear interpolation.

  \warning This #includes BackProjectorByBinUsingInterpolation_3DCho.cxx

  This very ugly way of including a .cxx file is used to avoid replication of
  a lot of (difficult) code.
