STIR: Software for Tomographic Image Reconstruction.

STIR is Open Source software for use in tomographic imaging. Its aim is to
provide a Multi-Platform Object-Oriented framework for all data
manipulations in tomographic imaging. Currently, the emphasis is on
(iterative) image reconstruction in PET and SPECT, but other application
areas and imaging modalities can and might be added.

STIR is the successor of the PARAPET software library which was the result
of a (European Union funded) collaboration between 6 different partners
(see the CREDITS file).

Please check the STIR web-site at http://STIR.sourceforge.net for more
information.
