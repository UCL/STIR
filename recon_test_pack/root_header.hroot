;; [...] the readout depth depends upon how the electronic readout functions.
;; If one PMT reads the four modules in the axial direction, 
;; the depth should be set with the command:
;; /gate/digitizer/Singles/readout/setDepth 1

; In STIR terminology this will be used to define the number of crystals
